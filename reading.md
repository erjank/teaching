# Further Reading

*   Ambrose et al's *How Learning Works* {{"bib:ambrose-hlw"|cite}} is
    the best overview of what we know about teaching and learning and
    why we believe it's true.  It's also a great example of secondary
    literature: every topic gets a few pages, with pointers to the
    primary literature for those who want to dive in further.

*   Brookfield and Preskill's *The Discussion Book*
    {{"bib:preskill-discussion"|cite}} is a catalog of ways to get groups
    (including classes) talking to one another productively.

*   Green's *Building a Better Teacher* {{"bib:green-babt"|cite}} looks
    at how attempts to reform public education in the United States (and
    other English-speaking countries) have foundered over the last forty
    years because they're focusing on the wrong things.

*   Guzdial's *Learner-Centered Design of Computing Education*
    {{"bib:guzdial-lcd"|cite}} is an evidence-based argument that we must
    design computing education for everyone, not just people who think
    they are going to become full-time professional programmers, and
    draws material from the author's excellent blog {{"bib:guzdial-blog"|cite}}.

*   Huston's *Teaching What You Don't Know*
    {{"bib:huston-dont-know"|cite}} is a good evidence-based guide to doing
    exactly that.

*   Lang's *Small Teaching* {{"bib:lang-small-teaching"|cite}} is a
    short guide to evidence-based teaching practices that can be adopted
    without requiring large up-front investments of time and money.

*   Lemov's *Teaching Like a Champion* {{"bib:lemov-champion"|cite}} is
    a catalog of good pedagogical practices drawn from observations of
    hundreds of teachers over thousands of hours.

*   Margolis and Fisher's *Unlocking the Clubhouse*
    {{"bib:margolis-fisher-clubhouse"|cite}} and Margolis et al's
    *Stuck in the Shallow End* {{"bib:margolis-shallow"|cite}} look at
    how women and some racial minorities are systematically pushed out
    of computing, and what can be done about it.
