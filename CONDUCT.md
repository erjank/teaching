We are dedicated to providing a welcoming and supportive environment
for all people, regardless of background or identity.  However, we
recognize that some groups in our community are subject to historical
and ongoing discrimination, and may be vulnerable or disadvantaged.
Membership in such a specific group can be on the basis of
characteristics such as such as gender, sexual orientation,
disability, physical appearance, body size, race, nationality, sex,
colour, ethnic or social origin, pregnancy, citizenship, familial
status, veteran status, genetic information, religion or belief,
political or any other opinion, membership of a national minority,
property, birth, age, or choice of text editor.  We do not tolerate
harassment of participants on the basis of these categories, or for
any other reason.

Harassment is any form of behaviour intended to exclude, intimidate,
or cause discomfort.  Because we are a diverse community, we may have
different ways of communicating and of understanding the intent behind
actions.  Therefore we have chosen to prohibit certain forms of
behaviour in our community, regardless of intent.  Prohibited
harassing behaviour includes but is not limited to:

*   written or verbal comments which have the effect of excluding people
    on the basis of membership of a specific group listed above;

*   causing someone to fear for their safety, such as through stalking,
    following, or intimidation;

*   the display of sexual or violent images;

*   unwelcome sexual attention;

*   nonconsensual or unwelcome physical contact;

*   sustained disruption of talks, events or communications;

*   incitement to violence, suicide, or self-harm;

*   continuing to initiate interaction (including photography or
    recording) with someone after being asked to stop; and

*   publication of private communication without consent.

Behaviour not explicitly mentioned above may still constitute
harassment.  The list above should not be taken as exhaustive but
rather as a guide to make it easier to enrich all of us and the
communities in which we participate.  All interactions should be
professional regardless of location: harassment is prohibited whether
it occurs on or offline, and the same standards apply to both.

Enforcement of the Code of Conduct will be respectful and not include
any harassing behaviors.

Thank you for helping make this a welcoming, friendly community for
all.
