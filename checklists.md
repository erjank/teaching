# Checklists

FIXME: make it clear that these are sample checklists for actual
workshops, not instructor training events.

See Atul Gawande's 2007 article "[The Checklist][gawande-checklist]"
for a look at how using checklists can save lives (and make many other
things better too).

## Scheduling the Event

1.  Decide if it will be in person, online for one site, or online for
    several.

1.  Talk through expectations with the host(s).  If it is in person,
    make sure the host knows they're covering travel costs for
    trainers.

1.  Determine who is allowed to attend.

1.  Arrange trainers.

1.  Arrange space.
    Make sure there are breakout rooms for video recording.

1.  Choose dates.
    If it is in person, book travel.

1.  Get names and email addresses of attendees from host(s).

1.  Make sure people are added to whatever online registration system is
    being used.

## Setting Up

1.  Set up a one-page website for the workshop.

1.  Add the URL for the workshop website to the tracking system.

1.  Check whether any attendees have special needs.

1.  If the workshop is online, test the video conference link.

1.  Make sure attendees will all have network access.

1.  Create an Etherpad or Google Doc for shared notes.

1.  Email attendees a welcome message that includes:
    *   a link to the workshop home page
    *   background readings
    *   a description of any pre-requisite tasks

## During the Event

1.  Remind everyone of the code of conduct.

1.  Collect attendance.

1.  Distribute sticky notes.

1.  Collect relevant online account IDs (e.g., GitHub IDs).

1.  Go through the checkout procedure point by point.

1.  Explain how to contribute to lessons.

## After the Event

1.  Update online records of who participated in what role.

1.  Administer the post-training survey.

1.  Email attendees about the checkout process.

1.  Debrief with the head of instructor training.

1.  Oversee final demonstrations.

## Between Instructor Training Sessions

1.  Sign up to lead group lesson discussions.

1.  Monitor lessons for contributions and give feedback.

## After Trainees Complete

1.  Send new instructors a completion message.

1.  Create certificates and send them to learners.

Note that trainers do not examine their own trainees:
having them examine each other's helps balance load
and maintain consistency of curriculum and standards.
