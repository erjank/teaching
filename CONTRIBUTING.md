# How to Contribute

We welcome contributions of all kinds, from errata to suggestions for
improvements to new material.  The source for this book is stored in a
[GitHub repository][repo], so if you would like to add or fix
something:

1.  Fork [our repository][repo] and then clone that to your desktop.

1.  Create a branch in your desktop Git repository.

1.  Edit the file containing the section you wish to change.

1.  Commit your changes.

1.  Push that branch to your repository on GitHub.

1.  Submit a pull request from your branch in your repository to the master repository.

The hardest part of this–and it is hard–is learning how to use
[Git][git].  In order for this not to be a barrier, you can also
[email your changes][editor-email] to the editor.  Please note that by
doing so, you are agreeing that we may incorporate your changes in
either original or edited form and release them under the same
[license](LICENSE.md) as the rest of this material.  Please also note
that we require everyone involved in this project to abide by [our
code of conduct](CONDUCT.md).

Finally, we are always grateful to hear how you have used this
material and how we could make it better.  Please [email
us][editor-email] if you have a story you would like to share.
