# Teaching as a Performance Art

Many people assume that teachers are born, not made. From politicians
to researchers and teachers themselves, reformers have designed
systems to find and promote those who can teach and eliminate those
who can't. But as Elizabeth Green explains in
*Building a Better Teacher* {{"bib:green-babt"|cite}}, that
assumption is wrong, which is why educational reforms based on it
have repeatedly failed.

The book is written as a history of the people who have put that puzzle
together in the US. Its core begins with a discussion of what James
Stigler discovered during a visit to Japan in the early 1990s:

> Some American teachers called their pattern "I, We, You": After
> checking homework, teachers announced the day's topic, demonstrating
> a new procedure (I)… Then they led the class in trying out a
> sample problem together (We)… Finally, they let students work
> through similar problems on their own, usually by silently making
> their way through a worksheet (You)…
>
> The Japanese teachers, meanwhile, turned "I, We, You" inside
> out. You might call their version "You, Y'all, We." They began not
> with an introduction, but a single problem that students spent ten
> or twenty minutes working through alone (You)… While the
> students worked, the teacher wove through the students' desks,
> studying what they came up with and taking notes to remember who had
> which idea. Sometimes the teacher then deployed the students to
> discuss the problem in small groups (Y'all). Next, the teacher
> brought them back to the whole group, asking students to present
> their different ideas for how to solve the problem on the
> chalkboard… Finally, the teacher led a discussion, guiding
> students to a shared conclusion (We).

It's tempting but wrong to think that this particular teaching
technique is some kind of secret sauce. The actual key is revealed in
the description of Akihiko Takahashi's work. In 1991, he visited the
United States in a vain attempt to find the classrooms described a
decade earlier in a report by the National Council of Teachers of
Mathematics. He couldn't find them. Instead, he found that American
teachers met once a year (if that) to exchange ideas about teaching,
compared to the weekly or even daily meetings he was used to. What was
worse:

> The teachers described lessons they gave and things students said,
> but they did not *see* the practices. When it came to observing
> actual lessons–watching each other teach–they simply had no
> opportunity… They had, he realized, no *jugyokenkyu*.
> Translated literally as "lesson study", *jugyokenkyu* is a
> bucket of practices that Japanese teachers use to hone their craft,
> from observing each other at work to discussing the lesson afterward
> to studying curriculum materials with colleagues. The practice is so
> pervasive in Japanese schools that it is…effectively
> invisible.
> 
> And here lay the answer to [Akihiko's] puzzle. Of course the
> American teachers' work fell short of the model set by their best
> thinkers… Without *jugyokenkyu*, his own classes would
> have been equally drab. Without *jugyokenkyu*, how could you
> even teach?

So what does *jugyokenkyu* look like in practice?

Putting work under a microscope in order to improve it is commonplace
in sports and music.  A professional musician, for example, will
dissect half a dozen different recordings of "Body and Soul" or
"Smells Like Teen Spirit" before performing it. They would also expect
to get feedback from fellow musicians during practice and after
performances.  Many other disciplines work this way too: the Japanese
drew inspiration from [Deming's ideas on continuous improvement in
manufacturing][wikipedia-deming], while the adoption of code review
over the last 15 years has done more to improve everyday programming
than any number of books or websites.

But this kind of feedback isn't part of teaching culture in the US,
the UK, Canada, or Australia.  There, what happens in the classroom
stays in the classroom: teachers don't watch each other's lessons on a
regular basis, so they can't borrow each other's good ideas. The
result is that *every teacher has to invent teaching on their
own*. They may get lesson plans and assignments from colleagues, the
school board, a textbook publisher, or the Internet, but each teacher
has to figure out on their own how to combine that with the theory
they've learned in education school to deliver an actual lesson in an
actual classroom for actual students.

Demonstration lessons, in which one teacher is in front of a room full
of students while other teachers observe, seem like a way to solve
this.  However, Fincher and her colleagues studied how teaching
practices are actually transferred using both a detailed case
study {{"bib:fincher-warrens-questions"|cite}} and analysis of change
stories {{"bib:fincher-stories-change"|cite}}.  The abstract of the latter
paper sums up their findings:

> Innovative tools and teaching practices often fail to be adopted by
> educators in the field, despite evidence of their effectiveness.
> Naïve models of educational change assume this lack of adoption
> arises from failure to properly disseminate promising work, but
> evidence suggests that dissemination via publication is simply not
> effective… We asked educators to describe changes they had
> made to their teaching practice and analyzed the resulting
> stories… Of the 99 change stories analyzed, only three
> demonstrate an active search for new practices or materials on the
> part of teachers, and published materials were consulted in just
> eight of the stories. Most of the changes occurred locally, without
> input from outside sources, or involved only personal interaction
> with other educators.

Barker et al found something similar {{"bib:barker-practice-adoption"|cite}}:

> Adoption is not a "rational action," however, but an iterative
> series of decisions made in a social context, relying on normative
> traditions, social cueing, and emotional or intuitive
> processes… Faculty are not likely to use educational research
> findings as the basis for adoption decisions. Faculty become aware
> of innovative practices either because a problem leads them to
> intentionally seek them out, or they hear about them through funded
> initiatives, conferences and journals, or from colleagues. They
> experiment (or not) for several reasons, depending on institutional
> expectations and policies, perceived costs and benefits for
> themselves and students, and the influence of role models. Faculty
> tend to trust other faculty whose work and institutional context is
> more like their own. The choice to try out practices competes with

This phenomenon is sometimes called *lateral knowledge transfer*:
someone sets out to teach X, but while watching them, their audience
actually learns Y as well (or instead). For example, an instructor
might set out to show people how to do a particular statistical
analysis in R, but what her learners might take away is some new
keyboard shortcuts in R Studio. Live coding makes this much more
likely because it allows learners to see the "how" as well as the
"what".

## Feedback

![Feedback Feelings](fig/deathbulge-jerk.jpg)

As the cartoon above suggests, sometimes it can be hard to receive
feedback, especially negative feedback.  The process is easier and
more productive when the people involved share ground rules and
expectations. This is especially important when they have different
backgrounds or cultural expectations about what's appropriate to say
and what isn't.

There are several things you can do to make feedback more effective:

1.  *Initiate feedback.* It's better to ask for feedback than to
    receive it unwillingly.

1.  *Choose your own questions*, i.e., ask for specific
    feedback. It's a lot harder for someone to answer, "What do you
    think?" than to answer either, "What is one thing I could have
    done as an instructor to make this lesson more effective?"  or "If
    you could pick one thing from the lesson to go over again, what
    would it be?"

    Directing feedback like this is also more helpful to you.  It's
    always better to try to fix one thing at once than to change
    everything and hope it's for the better.  Directing feedback at
    something you have chosen to work on helps you stay focused, which
    in turn increases the odds that you'll see progress.

1.  *Balance positive and negative feedback.*  One method is a
    "compliment sandwiches" made up of one positive, one negative, and
    a second positive observation.  Another (which we discuss below) is
    to ask for at least one point in each of several categories.

1.  Use a feedback translator. Have a fellow instructor (or other
    trusted person in the room) read over all the feedback and give an
    executive summary. It can be easier to hear "It sounds like most
    people are following, so you could speed up" than to read several
    notes all saying, "this is too slow" or "this is boring".

1.  Most importantly, *be kind to yourself*.  Many of us are very
    critical of ourselves, so it's always helpful to jot down what we
    thought of ourselves *before* getting feedback from others.
    That allows us to compare what we think of our performance with what
    others think, which in turn allows us to scale the former more
    accurately.  For example, it's very common for people to think that
    they're saying "um" and "err" all the time, when their audience
    doesn't notice it.  Getting that feedback once allows instructors to
    adjust their assessment of themselves the next time they feel that
    way.

The technique we find most useful for giving feedback is to create a
2x2 grid and put each piece of feedback in one of its four
squares.  The vertical axis divides positive from negative; the
horizontal divides content from presentation, i.e., what was said from
how it was said.  Even this little bit of structure helps people
figure out what to say, and to separate those who have good ideas that
they can't communicate from those who are eloquent but don't actually
have anything to say.

If you are interested in knowing more about giving and getting
feedback, you may want to read Gormally et al's "Feedback about
Teaching in Higher Ed" {{"bib:gormally-teaching-feedback"|cite}} and
discuss ways you could make peer-to-peer feedback a routine part of
your teaching.  You may also enjoy Gawande's essay "Personal Best"
{{"bib:gawande-personal-best"|cite}}, which looks at the value of
having a coach.

## Challenges

### Giving Feedback

1.  Watch [this video][video-bad-teaching] as a group and then give
    feedback on it. Organize feedback along two axes: positive
    vs. negative and content vs. presentation.

1.  Have each person in the class add one point to a 2x2 grid
    on a whiteboard (or in the shared notes) without duplicating any
    points that are already up there.

What did other people see that you missed?  What did they think that
you strongly agree or disagree with?

### Feedback on Your Teaching

1.  Split into groups of three.

1.  Have each person introduce themselves and then explain, in no more
    than 90 seconds, the key idea or ideas from the Carpentry lesson
    episode they chose before the start of the training course to another
    person in the group while the third person records it (video and
    audio) using a cell phone or some other handheld device.

1.  After the first person finishes, rotate roles (she becomes the
    videographer, her audience becomes the instructor, the person who was
    recording becomes the audience) and then rotate roles again.

1.  After everyone in the group of three has finished teaching, watch the
    videos as a group. Everyone gives feedback on all three videos, i.e.,
    people give feedback on themselves as well as on others.

1.  After everyone has given feedback on all of the videos, return to the
    main group and put all of the feedback into the notes.  Again, try to
    divide positive from negative and content from presentation.  Try
    also to identify each person's tells: what do they do that betrays
    nervousness, and how noticeable is it?
