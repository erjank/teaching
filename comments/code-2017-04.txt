Overall, I think this is shaping up to be a great resource for the
instructor training program. A sample schedule (or two for contrast)
may be helpful for both the Carpentry-style workshops and the
instructor training workshops, though perhaps only makes sense for the
latter in here since it is more standard on terms of content.
