\chapter*{The Rules}

\begin{genumerate}

\item
  Be kind: all else is details.

\item
  Never teach alone.

\item
  No lesson survives first contact with learners.

\item
  Nobody will be more excited about the lesson than you are.

\item
  Every lesson is too short from the teacher's point of view and too
  long from the learner's.

\item
  Never hesitate to sacrifice truth for clarify.

\item
  Every mistake is a lesson.

\item
  ``I learned this a long time ago'' is not the same as ``this is
  easy''.

\item
  Ninety percent of magic consists of knowing one extra thing.

\item
  You can't help everyone, but you can always help someone.
