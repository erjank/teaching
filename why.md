# Why I Teach

When I first started volunteering at the University of Toronto,
students sometimes asked me why I did it. This was my answer:

> When I was your age, I thought universities existed to teach people
> how to learn. Later, in grad school, I thought universities were about
> doing research and creating new knowledge. Now that I'm in my forties,
> though, I've realized that what we're really teaching you is how to
> take over the world, because you're going to have to one day whether
> you like it or not.
>
> My parents are in their seventies. They don't run the world any
> more: it's people my age who pass laws, set interest rates, and make
> life-and-death decisions in hospitals. As scary as it is, *we* have
> become the grownups.
>
> Twenty years from now, though, we'll be heading for retirement and
> *you* will be in charge.  That may sound like a long time when
> you're nineteen, but take three breaths and it's gone. That's why we
> give you problems whose answers can't be cribbed from last year's

> out what needs to be done right now, what can be left for later, and
> what you can simply ignore. It's because if you don't learn how to
> do these things now, you won't be ready to do them when you have to.

It's all true, but isn't the whole story. I don't want people to make
the world a better place so that I can retire in comfort. I want them
to do it because it's the greatest adventure of our time. A hundred
and fifty years ago, most societies still practiced slavery. A hundred
years ago, when my grandmother was young, she [wasn't legally a
person][famous5] in Canada.  Fifty years ago, most of the world's
people suffered under totalitarian rule; in the year I was born,
judges could–and did–order electroshock therapy to "cure" homosexuals.
Yes, there's still a lot wrong with the world, but look at how many
more choices we have than our grandparents did. Look at how many more
things we can know, and be, and enjoy.

This didn't happen by chance. It happened because millions of people
made millions of little decisions, the sum of which was a better
world. We don't think of these day-to-day decisions as political, but
every time we buy one brand of running shoe instead of another or
shout an anatomical insult instead of a racial one at a cab driver,
we're choosing one vision of the world instead of another.

In his 1947 essay "[Why I Write][orwell-why-i-write]", George Orwell
said:

> In a peaceful age I might have written ornate or merely descriptive
> books, and might have remained almost unaware of my political
> loyalties. As it is I have been forced into becoming a sort of
> pamphleteer… Every line of serious work that I have written since
> 1936 has been written, directly or indirectly, against
> totalitarianism… It seems to me nonsense, in a period like our own,
> to think that one can avoid writing of such subjects. Everyone
> writes of them in one guise or another. It is simply a question of
> which side one takes…

Replace "writing" with "teaching" and you'll have the reason I do what
I do. The world doesn't get better on its own. It gets better because
people make it better: penny by penny, vote by vote, and one lesson at
a time.
