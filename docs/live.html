<p><em>Teaching is theater not cinema.</em><br>&#x2013; Neal Davis</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Teaching is a performance art, just like drama, music, and athletics.
And as in those fields, we have a collection of small tips and tricks
to make teaching work better.</p>
<p>The first of our recommended teaching practices is so central that it
deserves a chapter of its own: live coding.  When they are live
coding, instructors don&apos;t use slides.  Instead, they through the
lesson material, typing in the code or instructions, with their
learners following along.  Its advantages are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Watching a program being written is more compelling than watching
someone page through slides that present bits and pieces of the same
code.</p>
</li>
<li><p>It enables instructors to be more responsive to &quot;what if?&quot;
questions. Where a slide deck is like a railway track, live coding
allows instructors to go off road and follow their learners&apos;
interests.</p>
</li>
<li><p>It facilitates lateral knowledge transfer: people learn more than we
realized we were teaching by watching <em>how</em> instructors do
things.</p>
</li>
<li><p>It slows the instructor down: if she has to type in the program as
she goes along, she can only go twice as fast as her learners,
rather than ten-fold faster as she could with slides.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Learners get to see instructors&apos; mistakes <em>and how to diagnose
and correct them</em>. Novices are going to spend most of their time
doing this, but it&apos;s left out of most textbooks.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Watching instructors make mistakes shows learners that it&apos;s all
right to make mistakes of their.  Most people model the behavior of
their teachers: if the instructor isn&apos;t embarrassed about making and
talking about mistakes, learners will be more comfortable doing so
too.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Live coding is an example of the &quot;I/We/You&quot; approach to teaching
discussed in <a href="performance">Performance</a>.  It takes a bit of practice
for instructors to get used to thinking aloud while coding in front of
an audience, but most report that it is then no more difficult to do
than talking off a deck of slides.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Double Devices</strong></p>
<p>Many instructors now use two devices when teaching: a laptop plugged
into the projector for learners to see, and a tablet beside it on
which they can view their notes and the shared notes that the learners
are taking.  This seems to be more reliable than displaying one
virtual desktop while flipping back and forth to another.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here are some tips to make your live coding better:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><em>Be seen and heard.</em>  If you are physically able to stand up
for a couple of hours, do it while you are teaching. When you sit
down, you are hiding yourself behind others for those sitting in the
back rows. Make sure to notify the workshop organizers of your wish
to stand up and ask them to arrange a high table, standing desk, or
lectern.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether you are standing or sitting, make sure to move
around as much as reasonable. You can for example go to the screen
to point something out, or draw something on the white/blackboard
(see below). Moving around makes the teaching more lively, less
monotonous.  It draws the learners&apos; attention away from their
screens, to you, which helps get the point you are making across.</p>
<p>Even though you may have a good voice and know how to use it well,
it may be a good idea to use a microphone, especially if the
workshop room is equipped with one. Your voice will be less tired,
and you increase the chance of people with hearing difficulties
being able to follow the workshop.</p>
</li>
<li><p><em>Take it slow.</em>  For every command you type, every word of code
you write, every menu item or website button you click, say out loud
what you are doing while you do it. Then point to the command and
its output on the screen and go through it a second time. This not
only slows you down, it allows learners who are following along to
copy what you do, or to catch up, even when they are looking at
their screen while doing it. If the output of your command or code
makes what you just typed disappear from view, scroll back up so
learners can see it again - this is especially needed for the Unix
shell lesson.</p>
<p>Other options are to execute the same command a second time, or to
copy and paste the last command(s) into the workshop&apos;s shared notes.</p>
</li>
<li><p><em>Mirror your learner&apos;s environment as much as possible.</em>  You
may have set up your environment to your liking, with a very simple
or rather fancy Unix prompt, colour schemes for your development
environment, keyboard shortcuts etc. Your learners usually won&apos;t
have all of this. Try to create an environment that mirrors what
your learners have, and avoid using keyboard shortcuts. Some
instructors create a separate <code>bare-bone&apos; user (login) account on
their laptop, or a separate</code>teaching-only&apos; account on the service
being taught (e.g., Github).</p>
</li>
<li><p><em>Use the screen wisely.</em>  Use a big font, and maximize the
window. A black font on a white background works better than a light
font on a dark background. When the bottom of the projector screen
is at the same height, or below, the heads of the learners, people
in the back won&apos;t be able to see the lower parts. Draw up the bottom
of your window(s) to compensate.</p>
<p>If you can get a second screen, use it! It will usually require its
own PC or laptop, so you may need to ask a helper to control it. You
could use the second screen to show the Etherpad content, or the
lesson material, or illustrations.</p>
<p>Pay attention to the lighting (not too dark, no lights directly
on/above the presenter&apos;s screen) and if needed, reposition the
tables so all learners can see the screen, and helpers can easily
reach all learners.</p>
</li>
<li><p><em>Use illustrations.</em>  Most lesson material comes with
illustrations, and these may help learners to understand the stages
of the lesson and to organize the material. What can work really
well is when you as instructor generate the illustrations on the
white/blackboard as you progress through the material. This allows
you to build up diagrams, making them increasingly complex in
parallel with the material you are teaching. It helps learners
understand the material, makes for a more lively workshop (you&apos;ll
have to move between your laptop and the blackboard) and gathers the
learners&apos; attention to you as well.</p>
</li>
<li><p><em>Avoid distractions.</em>  Turn off any notifications you may use
on your laptop, such as those from social media, email, etc. Seeing
notifications flash by on the screen distracts you as well as the
learners - and may even result in awkward situations when a message
pops up you&apos;d rather not have others see.</p>
</li>
<li><p><em>Improvise after you know the material.</em>  The first time you
teach a new lesson, you should stick fairly closely to the topics it
lays out and the order they&apos;re in.  It may be tempting to deviate
from the material because you would like to show a neat trick, or
demonstrate some alternative way of doing something. Don&apos;t do this,
since there is a fair chance you&apos;ll run into something unexpected
that you then have to explain.</p>
<p>Once you are more familiar with the material, though, you can and
should start improvising based on the backgrounds of your learners,
their questions in class, and what you find most interesting about
the lesson.  This is like a musician playing a new song: the first
few times, you stick to the sheet music, but after you&apos;re
comfortable with it, you can start to put your own stamp on it.</p>
<p>If you really want to use something outside of the material, try it
out thoroughly before the workshop: run through the lesson as you
would during the actual teaching and test the effect of your
modification.</p>
<p>Some instructors use printouts of the lesson material during
teaching.  Others use a second device (tablet or laptop) when
teaching, on which they can view their own notes and the shared
notes the learners are taking. This seems to be more reliable than
displaying one virtual desktop while flipping back and forth to
another.</p>
</li>
<li><p><em>Embrace mistakes.</em></p>
<p>No matter how well prepared you are, you will be making
mistakes. Typo&apos;s are hard to avoid, you may overlook something from
the lesson instructions, etc. This is OK! It allows learners to see
instructors&apos; mistakes and how to diagnose and correct them. Some
mistakes are actually an opportunity to point something out, or
reflect back on something covered earlier. Novices are going to
spend most of their time making the same and other mistakes, but how
to deal with them is left out of most textbooks.</p>
</li>
<li><p><em>Have fun.</em>  Teaching is performance art and can be rather
serious business. On the one hand, don&apos;t let this scare you - it is
much easier than performing Hamlet. You have an excellent script at
your disposal, after all! On the other hand, it is OK to add an
element of play, i.e. use humor and improvisation to liven up the
workshop. How much you are able and willing to do this is really a
matter of personality and taste - as well as experience. It becomes
easier when you are more familiar with the material, allowing you to
relax more. Choose your words and actions wisely, though. Remember
that we want the learners to have a welcoming experience and a
positive learning environment - a misplaced joke can ruin this in an
instant. Start small, even just saying `that was fun&apos; after
something worked well is a good start. Ask your co-instructors and
helpers for feedback when you are unsure of the effect you behaviour
has on the workshop.</p>

<p>Watch this video of <a href="https://youtu.be/bXxBeNkKmJE" target="_blank">live coding done poorly</a> and
then this video of <a href="https://youtu.be/SkPmwe_WjeY" target="_blank">live coding done well</a> as a
group and then summarize your feedback on both using the usual 2&#xD7;2
grid.  These videos assume learners know what a shell variable is,
know how to use the <code>head</code> command, and are familiar with the contents
of the data files being filtered.</p>
<h3 id="see-then-do">See Then Do</h3>
<p>Teach 3-4 minutes of your chosen lesson episode using live coding to a
fellow trainee, then swap and watch while that person live codes for
you. Don&apos;t bother trying to record the live coding sessions&#x2013;we have
found that it&apos;s difficult to capture both the person and the screen
