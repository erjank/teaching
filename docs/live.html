</blockquote>
<p>Teaching is a performance art, just like drama, music, and athletics.
And as in those fields, we have a collection of small tips and tricks
to make teaching work better.</p>
<p>The first of our recommended teaching practices is so central that it
deserves a chapter of its own: <em><a href="glossary.md#live-coding">live
coding</a></em>.  When they are live coding,
instructors don&apos;t use slides.  Instead, they go through the lesson
material, typing in the code or instructions, with their learners
following along.  Its advantages are:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Watching a program being written is more compelling than watching
someone page through slides that present bits and pieces of the same
code.</p>
</li>
<li><p>It enables instructors to be more responsive to &quot;what if?&quot;
questions. Where a slide deck is like a railway track, live coding
allows instructors to go off road and follow their learners&apos;
interests.</p>
</li>
<li><p>It facilitates lateral knowledge transfer: people learn more than we
realized we were teaching by watching <em>how</em> instructors do
things.</p>
</li>
<li><p>It slows the instructor down: if she has to type in the program as
she goes along, she can only go twice as fast as her learners,
rather than ten-fold faster as she could with slides.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Learners get to see instructors&apos; mistakes <em>and how to diagnose
and correct them</em>. Novices are going to spend most of their time
doing this, but it&apos;s left out of most textbooks.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Watching instructors make mistakes shows learners that it&apos;s all
right to make mistakes of their.  Most people model the behavior of
their teachers: if the instructor isn&apos;t embarrassed about making and
talking about mistakes, learners will be more comfortable doing so
too.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Live coding does have some drawbacks, but with practice, these can be
avoided or worked around:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Instructors can go too slowly, either because they are not good
typists or by spending too much time looking at notes to try to
remember what they meant to type.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Typing in boilerplate code that is needed by the lesson, but not
directly relevant to it (such as library import statements)
increases the <a href="load.html">extraneous cognitive load</a> on your
learners.  Willingham says &quot;Memory is the residue of thought&quot;
[<a href="biblio.html#willingham-dont-like-school">Willingham2010</a>], so if you
spend your time typing boilerplate, that may be what learners will
take away.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Teaching is theater not cinema.</em><br>&#x2013; Neal Davis</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Live coding is an example of the &quot;I/We/You&quot; approach to teaching
discussed in <a href="performance">Performance</a>.  It takes a bit of practice
for instructors to get used to thinking aloud while coding in front of
an audience, but most report that it is then no more difficult to do
than talking off a deck of slides.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Double Devices</strong></p>
<p>Many instructors now use two devices when teaching: a laptop plugged
into the projector for learners to see, and a tablet beside it on
which they can view their notes and the shared notes that the learners
are taking.  This seems to be more reliable than displaying one
virtual desktop while flipping back and forth to another.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here are some tips to make your live coding better:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><em>Be seen and heard.</em>  If you are physically able to stand up
for a couple of hours, do it while you are teaching. When you sit
down, you are hiding yourself behind others for those sitting in the
back rows. Make sure to notify the workshop organizers of your wish
to stand up and ask them to arrange a high table, standing desk, or
lectern.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether you are standing or sitting, make sure to move
around as much as reasonable. You can for example go to the screen
to point something out, or draw something on the white/blackboard
(see below). Moving around makes the teaching more lively, less
monotonous.  It draws the learners&apos; attention away from their
screens, to you, which helps get the point you are making across.</p>
<p>Even though you may have a good voice and know how to use it well,
it may be a good idea to use a microphone, especially if the
workshop room is equipped with one. Your voice will be less tired,
and you increase the chance of people with hearing difficulties
being able to follow the workshop.</p>
</li>
<li><p><em>Take it slow.</em> For every command you type, every word of code you
write, every menu item or website button you click, say out loud
what you are doing while you do it, then point to the command and
its output on the screen and go through it a second time. This not
only slows you down, it allows learners who are following along to
copy what you do, or to catch up, even when they are looking at
their screen while doing it.  Whatever you do, <em>don&apos;t</em> copy and
paste code: doing this practically guarantees that you&apos;ll race
ahead of your learners.</p>
<p>If the output of your command or code makes what you just typed
disappear from view, scroll back up so learners can see it again -
this is especially needed for the Unix shell lesson.  Other
options are to execute the same command a second time, or to copy
and paste the last command(s) into the workshop&apos;s shared notes.</p>
</li>
<li><p><em>Mirror your learner&apos;s environment as much as possible.</em>  You
may have set up your environment to your liking, with a very simple
or rather fancy Unix prompt, colour schemes for your development
environment, keyboard shortcuts etc. Your learners usually won&apos;t
have all of this. Try to create an environment that mirrors what
your learners have, and avoid using keyboard shortcuts. Some
instructors create a separate <code>bare-bone&apos; user (login) account on
their laptop, or a separate</code>teaching-only&apos; account on the service
being taught (e.g., Github).</p>
</li>
<li><p><em>Use the screen wisely.</em> You will need to enlarge your font
considerably in order for people to read it from the back of the
room, which means you can put much less on the screen than you&apos;re
used to<sup><a href="#fn_1" id="reffn_1">1</a></sup>.  Maximize your window, and then ask everyone to give
you a thumbs-up or thumbs-down on its readability.  Use a black
font on a lightly-tinted background rather than a light font on a
dark background&#x2013;the light tint will glare less than a pure white
background.</p>
<p>When the bottom of the projector screen is at the same height, or
below, the heads of the learners, people in the back won&apos;t be able
to see the lower parts. Draw up the bottom of your window(s) to
compensate.</p>
<p>Pay attention to the room lighting as well: it should not be fully
dark, and there should be no lights directly on or above the
presenter&apos;s screen.  If needed, reposition the tables so all
learners can see the screen.</p>
<p>If you can get a second screen, use it: the extra screen real
estate will allow you to display your code on one side and its
output or behavior on the other.  The second screen may require
its own PC or laptop, so you may need to ask a helper to control
it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Multiple Personalities</strong></p>
<p>If you teach using a console window, such as a Unix shell, it&apos;s
important to tell people when you run an in-console text editor
and when you return to the console prompt.  Most novices have
never seen a window take on multiple personalities in this way,
and can quickly become confused (particularly if the window is
hosting an interactive interpreter prompt for Python or some
other language as well as running shell commands and hosting
an editor).</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><p><em>Use illustrations.</em>  Most lesson material comes with
illustrations, and these may help learners to understand the stages
of the lesson and to organize the material. What can work really
well is when you as instructor generate the illustrations on the
white/blackboard as you progress through the material. This allows
you to build up diagrams, making them increasingly complex in
parallel with the material you are teaching. It helps learners
understand the material, makes for a more lively workshop (you&apos;ll
have to move between your laptop and the blackboard) and gathers the
learners&apos; attention to you as well.</p>
</li>
<li><p><em>Avoid distractions.</em>  Turn off any notifications you may use
on your laptop, such as those from social media, email, etc. Seeing
notifications flash by on the screen distracts you as well as the
learners - and may even result in awkward situations when a message
pops up you&apos;d rather not have others see.</p>
</li>
<li><p><em>Improvise after you know the material.</em>  The first time you
teach a new lesson, you should stick fairly closely to the topics it
lays out and the order they&apos;re in.  It may be tempting to deviate
from the material because you would like to show a neat trick, or
demonstrate some alternative way of doing something. Don&apos;t do this,
since there is a fair chance you&apos;ll run into something unexpected
that you then have to explain.</p>
<p>Once you are more familiar with the material, though, you can and
should start improvising based on the backgrounds of your learners,
their questions in class, and what you find most interesting about
the lesson.  This is like a musician playing a new song: the first
few times, you stick to the sheet music, but after you&apos;re
comfortable with it, you can start to put your own stamp on it.</p>
<p>If you really want to use something outside of the material, try it
out thoroughly before the workshop: run through the lesson as you
would during the actual teaching and test the effect of your
modification.</p>
<p>Some instructors use printouts of the lesson material during
teaching.  Others use a second device (tablet or laptop) when
teaching, on which they can view their own notes and the shared
notes the learners are taking. This seems to be more reliable than
displaying one virtual desktop while flipping back and forth to
another.</p>
</li>
<li><p><em>Embrace mistakes.</em></p>
<p>No matter how well prepared you are, you will be making
mistakes. Typo&apos;s are hard to avoid, you may overlook something from
the lesson instructions, etc. This is OK! It allows learners to see
instructors&apos; mistakes and how to diagnose and correct them. Some
mistakes are actually an opportunity to point something out, or
reflect back on something covered earlier. Novices are going to
spend most of their time making the same and other mistakes, but how
to deal with them is left out of most textbooks.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The typos are the pedagogy.</em><br>&#x2013; Emily Jane McTavish</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note: if you&apos;ve given a lesson several times, you&apos;re unlikely to
make anything other than basic typing mistakes (which usually
aren&apos;t informative). It&apos;s worth remembering &quot;real&quot; mistakes and
making them deliberately, but that often feels forced.  A better
approach is to get learners to tell you what to do next in the
hope that this will get you into the weeds.</p>
</li>
<li><p>It&apos;s OK to <em>face the screen occasionally</em>, particularly when you
are walking through a section of code statement by statement or
drawing a diagram, but you shouldn&apos;t do this for more than a few
seconds at a time<sup><a href="#fn_2" id="reffn_2">2</a></sup>.  A good rule of thumb is to treat the
screen as one of your learners: if it would be uncomfortable to
stare at someone for as long as you are spending looking at the
screen, it&apos;s time to turn around and face your audience.</p>
</li>
<li><p><em>Have fun.</em> Teaching is performance art and can be rather serious
business. On the one hand, don&apos;t let this scare you - it is much
easier than performing Hamlet. You have an excellent script at
your disposal, after all! On the other hand, it is OK to add an
element of play, i.e. use humor and improvisation to liven up the
workshop. How much you are able and willing to do this is really a
matter of personality and taste - as well as experience. It
becomes easier when you are more familiar with the material,
allowing you to relax more. Choose your words and actions wisely,
though. Remember that we want the learners to have a welcoming
experience and a positive learning environment - a misplaced joke
can ruin this in an instant. Start small, even just saying `that
was fun&apos; after something worked well is a good start. Ask your
co-instructors and helpers for feedback when you are unsure of the
effect your behaviour has on the workshop.</p>

<p>Watch this video of <a href="https://youtu.be/bXxBeNkKmJE" target="_blank">live coding done poorly</a> and
then this video of <a href="https://youtu.be/SkPmwe_WjeY" target="_blank">live coding done well</a> as a
group and then summarize your feedback on both using the usual 2&#xD7;2
grid.  These videos assume learners know what a shell variable is,
know how to use the <code>head</code> command, and are familiar with the contents
of the data files being filtered.</p>
<p><em>20 minutes</em></p>
<h3 id="see-then-do">See Then Do</h3>
<p>Teach 3-4 minutes of a lesson using live coding to a fellow trainee,
then swap and watch while that person live codes for you. Don&apos;t bother
trying to record the live coding sessions&#x2013;we have found that it&apos;s
difficult to capture both the person and the screen with a handheld
device&#x2013;but give feedback the same way you have previously (positive
and negative, content and presentation).  Explain in advance to your
fellow trainee what you will be teaching and what the learners you
teach it to are expected to be familiar with.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>What felt different about live coding (versus standing up and
lecturing)? What was harder/easier?</p>
</li>
<li><p>Did you make any mistakes? If so, how did you handle them?</p>
</li>
<li><p>Did you talk and type at the same time, or alternate?</p>
</li>
<li><p>How often did you point at the screen? How often did you highlight
with the mouse?</p>
</li>
<li><p>What will you try to do differently next time?</p>
