<p>This appendix includes material that doesn&apos;t naturally fit anywhere else.</p>
<h2 id="key-terms">Key Terms</h2>
<p><em><a href="gloss.html#educational-psychology">Educational psychology</a></em> is the
study of how people learn. It touches on everything from the
neuropsychology of perception and the mechanisms of memory to the
sociology of school systems and the philosophical question of what we
actually mean by &quot;learning&quot; (which turns out to be pretty complicated
once you start looking beyond the standardized Western
classroom). Within the broad scope of educational psychology, two
specific perspectives have primarily influenced our teaching practices
(and by extension, this instructor training).</p>
<p>The first perspective is <em><a href="gloss.html#cognitivism">cognitivism</a></em>,
which treats learning as a problem in neuropsychology. Cognitivists
focus their attention on things like pattern recognition, memory
formation, and recall. It is good at answering low-level questions,
but generally ignores larger issues like, &quot;What do we mean by
&apos;learning&apos;?&quot; and, &quot;Who gets to decide?&quot;</p>
<p>The second perspective is <em><a href="gloss.html#situated-learning">situated
learning</a></em>, which focuses on how
<em><a href="gloss.html#legitimate-peripheral-participation">legitimate peripheral
participation</a></em> leads
to people becoming members of a <em>[community of
practice][gloss.md#community-of-practice]</em>.  Unpacking those terms,
the situated learning perspective focuses on the transition from being
a newcomer to being accepted as a peer by those who already do the
activity in question. Situated learning is directly relevant to our
learners, many of whom ease into scientific computing by doing small
tasks that experienced practitioners would regard as straightforward,
but who learn how to take on bigger and more novel challenges both
from what they do and from the feedback (and welcome) it elicits. It
is equally relevant to our instructors (i.e., you), who are
approaching evidence-based teaching in the same way.</p>
<p>For example, Software Carpentry aims to serve researchers who are
exploring data management and programming on their own (legitimate
peripheral practice) and make them aware of other people doing that
work (simply by attending the workshop) and the best practices and
ideas of that community of practice, thereby giving them a way to
become members of that community. Situated learning thus describes why
we teach, and recognizes that teaching and learning is necessarily
rooted in a social context. We then depend on the cognitivist
perspective to drive <em>how</em> we teach the specific content associated
with the community of practice.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Other Perspectives</strong></p>
<p>There are many other perspectives outside cognitivist theory&#x2014;see
<a href="http://www.learning-theories.com/" target="_blank">this site</a> for summaries. Besides cognitivism,
those encountered most frequently include
<em><a href="gloss.html#behaviorism">behaviorism</a></em> (which treats education as
stimulus/response conditioning),
<em><a href="gloss.html#constructivism">constructivism</a></em> (which considers
learning an active process during which learners construct knowledge
for themselves), and <em><a href="gloss.html#connectivism">connectivism</a></em>
(which emphasizes the social aspects of learning, particularly those
made possible by the Internet).  And yes, it would help if their
names were less similar&#x2026;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Educational psychology does not tell us how to teach on its own
because it under-constrains the problem: in real life, several
different teaching methods might be consistent with what we currently
know about how learning works. We therefore have to try those methods
in the class, with actual learners, in order to find out how well they
balance the different forces in play.</p>
<p>Doing this is called <em><a href="gloss.html#instructional-design">instructional
design</a></em>.  If educational psychology is
the science, instructional design is the engineering.  For example,
there are good reasons to believe that children will learn how to read
best by starting with the sounds of letters and working up to words.
However, there are equally good reasons to believe that children will
learn best if they are taught to recognize entire simple words like
&quot;open&quot; and &quot;stop&quot;, so that they can start using their knowledge
sooner<sup><a href="#fn_1" id="reffn_1">1</a></sup>.  The only way to tell which approach works best for most
children, most of the time, is to try them both out<sup><a href="#fn_2" id="reffn_2">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, effective teaching depends on what the teacher knows,
which can be divided into:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em><a href="gloss.html#content-knowledge">content knowledge</a></em>, such as the
&quot;what&quot; of programming;</p>
</li>
<li><p><em><a href="gloss.html#general-pedagogical-knowledge">general pedagogical
knowledge</a></em>, i.e., an
understanding of the psychology of learning; and</p>
</li>
<li><p>the <em><a href="gloss.html#pedagogical-content-knowledge">pedagogical content
knowledge</a></em> (PCK) that
connects the two. PCK is things like what examples to use when
teaching how parameters are passed to a function, or what
misconceptions about wildcard expansion are most common.  For
example, an instructor could write variable names and values on
paper plates and then stack and unstack them to show how the call
stack works.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>A great example of PCK is Gelman and Nolan&apos;s <em>[Teaching Statistics: A
Bag of Tricks]</em> [<a href="biblio.html#gelman-stats">Gelman2002</a>], which is full of
PCK for teaching introductory statistics.  The <a href="http://csteachingtips.org/" target="_blank">CS Teaching
Tips</a> site is gathering similar ideas for computing.</p>
<h2 id="myths">Myths</h2>
<p>One <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_styles#Learning_modalities" target="_blank">well-known scheme</a> characterizes
learners as visual, auditory, or kinesthetic according to whether they
like to see things, hear things, or do things. This scheme is easy to
understand, but as de Bruyckere and colleagues point out in <em>Urban
Myths About Learning and Education</em>
[<a href="biblio.html#debruyckere-urban-myths">DeBruyckere2015</a>], it is almost
certainly false.  Unfortunately, that hasn&apos;t stopped a large number of
companies from marketing products based on it to parents and school
boards.</p>
<p>This is not the only myth to plague education. The learning pyramid
that shows we remember 10% of what we read, 20% of what we hear, and
so on?  Myth. The idea that &quot;brain games&quot; can improve our
intelligence, or at least slow its decline in old age? Also a myth, as
are the claims that the Internet is making us dumber or that young
people read less than they used to.</p>
<p>Computing education has its own myths. Mark Guzdial&apos;s &quot;Top 10 Myths
About Teaching Computer Science&quot;
[<a href="biblio.html#guzdial-top10">Guzdial2015a</a>] are:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The lack of women in Computer Science is just like all the other
STEM fields.</p>
</li>
<li><p>To get more women in CS, we need more female CS faculty.</p>
</li>
<li><p>A good CS teacher is a good lecturer.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Clickers and the like are an add-on for a good teacher.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Student evaluations are the best way to evaluate teaching.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Good teachers personalize education for students&apos; learning styles.</p>
</li>
<li><p>High schools just can&apos;t teach CS well, so they shouldn&apos;t do it at all.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The real problem is to get more CS curriculum into the hands of
teachers.</p>
</li>
<li><p>All I need to do to be a good CS teacher is model good software
development practice, because my job is to produce excellent software
engineers.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Some people are just born to program.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The last of these is the most pervasive and most damaging.  As
discussed in <a href="motivation">Motivation</a>, Elizabeth Patitsas and others
have shown that grades in computing classes are <em>not</em> bimodal
[<a href="biblio.html#patitsas-cs-grades">Patitsas2016</a>], i.e., there isn&apos;t one
group that gets it and another that doesn&apos;t. Many of the participants
in our workshops have advanced degrees in intellectually demanding
subjects, but have convinced themselves that they just don&apos;t have what
it takes to be programmers. If all we do is dispel that belief, we
will have done them a service.</p>

<h2 id="effecting-change">Effecting Change</h2>
<p>This guide is aimed primarily at people working outside mainstream
educational institutions, but in order for us to reach and help as
many people as possible, we must eventually find ways to work with
schools as they are.  Henderson et al&apos;s &quot;Facilitating Change in
Undergraduate STEM Instructional Practices&quot;
[<a href="biblio.html#henderson-facilitating">Henderson2011</a>] discusses ways to
get educational institutions to actually change what they teach.  The
approaches they identify include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Diffusion</em>: STEM undergraduate instruction will be changed by
altering the behavior of a large number of individual
instructors. The greatest influences for changing instructor
behavior lie in optimizing characteristics of the innovation and
exploiting the characteristics of individuals and their networks.</p>
</li>
<li><p><em>Implementation</em>: STEM undergraduate instruction will be
changed by developing research-based instructional &quot;best
practices&quot; and training instructors to use them. Instructors must
use these practices with fidelity to the established standard.</p>
</li>
<li><p><em>Scholarly Teaching</em>: STEM undergraduate instruction will be
changed when more individual faculty members treat their teaching as
a scholarly activity.</p>
</li>
<li><p><em>Faculty Learning Communities</em>: STEM undergraduate instruction
will be changed by groups of instructors who support and sustain
each other&apos;s interest, learning, and reflection on their teaching.</p>
</li>
<li><p><em>Quality Assurance</em>: STEM undergraduate instruction will be
changed by requiring institutions (colleges, schools, departments,
and degree programs) to collect evidence demonstrating their success
in undergraduate instruction. What gets measured is what gets
improved.</p>
</li>
<li><p><em>Organizational Development</em>: STEM undergraduate instruction
will be changed by administrators with strong vision who can develop
structures and motivate faculty to adopt improved instructional
practices.</p>
</li>
<li><p><em>Learning Organizations</em>: Innovation in higher education STEM
instruction will occur through informal communities of practice
within formal organizations in which individuals develop new
organizational knowledge through sharing implicit knowledge about
their teaching.  Leaders cultivate conditions for both formal and
informal communities to form and thrive.</p>
</li>
<li><p><em>Complexity Leadership</em>: STEM undergraduate instruction is
governed by a complex system. Innovation will occur through the
collective action of self-organizing groups within the system. This
collective action can be stimulated, but not controlled.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="evaluating-impact">Evaluating Impact</h2>
<p>A key part of effecting change is to convince people that what you&apos;re
doing is actually having a positive impact.  That turns out to be
surprisingly hard<sup><a href="#fn_3" id="reffn_3">3</a></sup> for free-range programming workshops:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><em>Ask learners if the workshop was useful.</em> Study after study has
shown that there is no correlation between how highly learners
rate a course and how much they actually learn
[<a href="biblio.html#uttl-evaluations">Uttl2016</a>], and most people working
in education are now aware of that.</p>
</li>
<li><p><em>Give them an exam at the end of the workshop.</em>  Doing that
dramatically changes the feel of the workshop, and how much they
know at the end of the day is a poor predictor of how much they
will remember two or three months later.</p>
</li>
<li><p><em>Give them an exam two or three months later.</em>  That&apos;s hard enough
to do in a traditional battery-farmed learning environment; doing
it with free-range learners is even harder.  In addition:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The people who didn&apos;t get anything out of the workshop are
probably less likely to take part in follow-up, so feedback
gathered this way will be subject to self-selection bias.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The fact that learners <em>remember</em> something doesn&apos;t
necessarily mean it was useful (although they are more likely
to remember things that are useful than things that aren&apos;t).</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p><em>See if they keep using what they learned.</em> This is a good way to
evaluate employment-oriented skills, but equally useful for things
people have learned for fun.  The problem is how to do it: you
probably shouldn&apos;t put spyware on their computers, and follow-up
surveys suffer from the same low return rate and self-selection
bias as exams.</p>
</li>
<li><p><em>See if they recommend the workshop to friends.</em> This method often
strikes the best balance between informative and doable: if people
are recommending your workshop to other people, that&apos;s a pretty
good sign.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>There are many other options; the most important thing is to figure
out early on how you&apos;re going to know whether you&apos;re teaching the
right things the right way, and how you&apos;re going to convince potential
backers that you&apos;re doing so.</p>
