<p>Many people assume that teachers are born, not made. From politicians
to researchers and teachers themselves, reformers have designed
systems to find and promote those who can teach and eliminate those
who can&apos;t. But as Elizabeth Green explains in
<a href="biblio.html#green-babt">Gree2014</a>, that assumption is wrong, which is
why educational reforms based on it have repeatedly failed.</p>
<p>The book is written as a history of the people who have put that
puzzle together in the US. Its core begins with a discussion of what
James Stigler discovered during a visit to Japan in the early 1990s:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some American teachers called their pattern &quot;I, We, You&quot;: After
checking homework, teachers announced the day&apos;s topic, demonstrating
a new procedure (I)&#x2026; Then they led the class in trying out a
sample problem together (We)&#x2026; Finally, they let students work
through similar problems on their own, usually by silently making
their way through a worksheet (You)&#x2026;</p>
<p>The Japanese teachers, meanwhile, turned &quot;I, We, You&quot; inside
out. You might call their version &quot;You, Y&apos;all, We.&quot; They began not
with an introduction, but a single problem that students spent ten
or twenty minutes working through alone (You)&#x2026; While the
students worked, the teacher wove through the students&apos; desks,
studying what they came up with and taking notes to remember who had
which idea. Sometimes the teacher then deployed the students to
discuss the problem in small groups (Y&apos;all). Next, the teacher
brought them back to the whole group, asking students to present
their different ideas for how to solve the problem on the
chalkboard&#x2026; Finally, the teacher led a discussion, guiding
students to a shared conclusion (We).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It&apos;s tempting but wrong to think that this particular teaching
technique is some kind of secret sauce. The actual key is a practice
called <em><a href="GLOSSARY.html#jugyokenkyu">jugyokenkyu</a></em>, which means &quot;lesson
study&quot;:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em><a href="GLOSSARY.html#jugyokenkyu" class="glossary-term" title="Literally &quot;lesson study&quot;, a set of practices that includes having
teachers routinely observe one another and discuss lessons to share
knowledge and improve skills.">Jugyokenkyu</a></em> is a bucket of practices that Japanese teachers use to
hone their craft, from observing each other at work to discussing
the lesson afterward to studying curriculum materials with
colleagues. The practice is so pervasive in Japanese schools that it
is&#x2026;effectively invisible.</p>
<p>In order to graduate, [Japanese] education majors not only had to
watch their assigned master teacher work, they had to effectively
replace him, installing themselves in his classroom first as
observers and then, by the third week, as a wobbly&#x2026;approximation of
the teacher himself.  It worked like a kind of teaching relay. Each
trainee took a subject, planning five days&apos; worth of lessons&#x2026; [and
then] each took a day. To pass the baton, you had to teach a day&apos;s
lesson in every single subject: the one you planned and the four you
did not&#x2026; and you had to do it right under your master teacher&apos;s
nose. Afterward, everyone&#x2013;the teacher, the college students, and
sometimes even another outside observer&#x2013;would sit around a formal
table to talk about what they saw.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Putting work under a microscope in order to improve it is commonplace
in sports and music.  A professional musician, for example, will
dissect half a dozen different recordings of &quot;Body and Soul&quot; or
&quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot; before performing it. They would also expect
to get feedback from fellow musicians during practice and after
performances.  Many other disciplines work this way too: the Japanese
drew inspiration from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._Edwards_Deming" target="_blank">Deming&apos;s ideas on continuous improvement in
manufacturing</a>, while the adoption of code review
over the last 15 years has done more to improve everyday programming
than any number of books or websites.</p>
<p>But this kind of feedback isn&apos;t part of teaching culture in the US,
the UK, Canada, or Australia.  There, what happens in the classroom
stays in the classroom: teachers don&apos;t watch each other&apos;s lessons on a
regular basis, so they can&apos;t borrow each other&apos;s good ideas. The
result is that <em>every teacher has to invent teaching on their
own</em>. They may get lesson plans and assignments from colleagues, the
school board, a textbook publisher, or the Internet, but each teacher
has to figure out on their own how to combine that with the theory
they&apos;ve learned in education school to deliver an actual lesson in an
actual classroom for actual students.</p>
<p>Demonstration lessons, in which one teacher is in front of a room full
of students while other teachers observe, seem like a way to solve
this.  However, Fincher and her colleagues studied how teaching
practices are actually transferred using both a detailed case study
<a href="biblio.html#fincher-warrens-questions">Fincher2007</a> and analysis of
change stories <a href="biblio.html#fincher-stories-change">Fincher2012</a>.  The
abstract of the latter paper sums up their findings:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Innovative tools and teaching practices often fail to be adopted by
educators in the field, despite evidence of their effectiveness.
Na&#xEF;ve models of educational change assume this lack of adoption
arises from failure to properly disseminate promising work, but
evidence suggests that dissemination via publication is simply not
effective&#x2026; We asked educators to describe changes they had made to
their teaching practice&#x2026; Of the 99 change stories analyzed, only
three demonstrate an active search for new practices or materials on
the part of teachers, and published materials were consulted in just
eight&#x2026; Most of the changes occurred locally, without input from
outside sources, or involved only personal interaction with other
educators.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Barker et al found something similar
<a href="biblio.html#barker-practice-adoption">Barker2015</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Adoption is not a &quot;rational action,&quot; however, but an iterative
series of decisions made in a social context, relying on normative
traditions, social cueing, and emotional or intuitive processes&#x2026;
Faculty are not likely to use educational research findings as the
basis for adoption decisions&#x2026; Positive student feedback is taken as
strong evidence by faculty that they should continue a practice.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This phenomenon is sometimes called <em><a href="GLOSSARY.html#lateral-knowledge-transfer">lateral knowledge
transfer</a></em>: someone sets out
to teach X, but while watching them, their audience actually learns Y
as well (or instead). For example, an instructor might set out to show
people how to do a particular statistical analysis in R, but what her
learners might take away is some new keyboard shortcuts in R
Studio. <a href="GLOSSARY.html#live-coding" class="glossary-term" title="The act of teaching programming by writing software in front of
learners as the lesson progresses.">Live coding</a> makes this much more likely because it allows
learners to see the &quot;how&quot; as well as the &quot;what&quot;, and <em><a href="GLOSSARY.html#jugyokenkyu" class="glossary-term" title="Literally &quot;lesson study&quot;, a set of practices that includes having
teachers routinely observe one another and discuss lessons to share
knowledge and improve skills.">jugyokenkyu</a></em>
works because it creates more opportunities for this to happen.</p>
<h2 id="feedback">Feedback</h2>
<p><img src="fig/deathbulge-jerk.jpg" alt="Feedback Feelings"></p>
<p>As the cartoon above suggests, sometimes it can be hard to receive
feedback, especially negative feedback.  The process is easier and
more productive when the people involved share ground rules and
expectations. This is especially important when they have different
backgrounds or cultural expectations about what&apos;s appropriate to say
and what isn&apos;t.</p>
<p>You can get better feedback on your work from other people using
techniques like these:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><em>Initiate feedback.</em> It&apos;s better to ask for feedback than to
receive it unwillingly.</p>
</li>
<li><p><em>Choose your own questions</em>, i.e., ask for specific
feedback. It&apos;s a lot harder for someone to answer, &quot;What do you
think?&quot; than to answer either, &quot;What is one thing I could have
done as an instructor to make this lesson more effective?&quot;  or &quot;If
you could pick one thing from the lesson to go over again, what
would it be?&quot;</p>
<p>Directing feedback like this is also more helpful to you.  It&apos;s
always better to try to fix one thing at once than to change
everything and hope it&apos;s for the better.  Directing feedback at
something you have chosen to work on helps you stay focused, which
in turn increases the odds that you&apos;ll see progress.</p>
</li>
<li><p><em>Use a feedback translator.</em> Have a fellow instructor (or other
trusted person in the room) read over all the feedback and give an
executive summary. It can be easier to hear &quot;It sounds like most
people are following, so you could speed up&quot; than to read several
notes all saying, &quot;this is too slow&quot; or &quot;this is boring&quot;.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Most importantly, <em>be kind to yourself</em>.  Many of us are very
critical of ourselves, so it&apos;s always helpful to jot down what we
thought of ourselves <em>before</em> getting feedback from others.
That allows us to compare what we think of our performance with what
others think, which in turn allows us to scale the former more
accurately.  For example, it&apos;s very common for people to think that
they&apos;re saying &quot;um&quot; and &quot;err&quot; all the time, when their audience
doesn&apos;t notice it.  Getting that feedback once allows instructors to
adjust their assessment of themselves the next time they feel that
way.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>You can give feedback to others more effectively as well:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><em>Balance positive and negative feedback.</em> One method is a
&quot;compliment sandwiches&quot; made up of one positive, one negative, and
a second positive observation.</p>
</li>
<li><p><em>Organize your feedback using a rubric.</em> Most people are more
comfortable giving and receiving feedback when they they feel that
understand the social rules governing what they are allowed to say
and how they are allowed to say it.  A facilitator can then
transcribe items into a shared document (or onto a whiteboard)
during discussion.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Two by Two</strong></p>
<p>The rubric we find most useful for feedback on teaching is a 2x2
grid whose vertical axis is labelled &quot;positive&quot; and &quot;negative&quot;, and
whose horizontal axis is labelled &quot;content&quot; (what was said) and
&quot;presentation (how it was said).  Observers write each of their
comments in one of the grid&apos;s four squares as they are watching the
demonstration.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Whatever methods are used, the most important thing to remember is
feedback on teaching is meant to be formative: its goal is to help
people figure out what they are doing well and what they still need to
work on.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Studio Classes</strong></p>
<p>Architecture schools often include studio classes, in which students
solve small design problems and get feedback from their peers right
then and there.  These classes are most effective when the
instructor critiques both the designs and the peer critiques, so
that participants are learning not only how to make buildings, but
how to give and get feedback
<a href="biblio.html#schon-practitioner">Schon1984</a>.  Master classes in music
serve a similar purpose, and a few people have experimented with
using <a href="GLOSSARY.html#live-coding" class="glossary-term" title="The act of teaching programming by writing software in front of
learners as the lesson progresses.">live coding</a> at conferences or online in similar ways.</p>
</blockquote>
<!-- comment needed to separate blockquotes -->
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Tells</strong></p>
<p>Everyone has nervous habits. For example, many of us become &quot;Mickey
Mouse&quot; versions of ourselves when we&apos;re nervous, i.e., we talk more
rapidly than usual, in a higher-pitched voice, and wave our arms
around more than we usually would.</p>
<p>Gamblers call nervous habits like this &quot;tells&quot;.  While these are
often not as noticeable as you would think, it&apos;s good to know
whether you pac, fiddle with your hair, look at your shoes, or
rattle the change in your pocket when you don&apos;t know the answer
to a question.</p>
<p>You can&apos;t get rid of tells completely, and trying to do so can make
you obsess about them.  A better strategy is to try to displace
them, e.g., to train yourself to scrunch your toes inside your shoes
instead of cracking your knuckles.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you are interested in knowing more about giving and getting
feedback, you may want to read

you could make peer-to-peer feedback a routine part of your teaching.

<h2 id="how-to-practice-teaching">How to Practice Teaching</h2>
<p>One of the key elements of instructor training is recording trainees
and having them, and their peers, critique those recordings. We were
introduced to this practice by UBC&apos;s Warren Code, who learned it from
the <a href="https://iswnetwork.ca/" target="_blank">Instructional Skills Workshop</a>,
and it has evolved to the following:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Split into groups of three.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Each person rotates through the roles of instructor, audience, and
videographer.  As the instructor, they have two minutes to explain
one key idea from their research (or other work) as if they were
talking to a class of interested high school students. The person
pretending to be the audience is there to be attentive, while the
videographer records the session using a cellphone or similar
device.</p>
</li>
<li><p>After everyone in the group of three has finished teaching, watch the
videos as a group. Everyone gives feedback on all three videos, i.e.,
people give feedback on themselves as well as on others.</p>
</li>
<li><p>After everyone has given feedback on all of the videos, return to the
main group and put all of the feedback into the notes.  Again, try to
divide positive from negative and content from presentation.  Try
also to identify each person&apos;s tells: what do they do that betrays
nervousness, and how noticeable is it?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>It&apos;s important to record all three videos and then watch all three: if
the cycle is teach-review-teach-review, the last person to teach runs
out of time. Doing all the reviewing after all the teaching also helps
put a bit of distance between the teaching and the reviewing, which
makes the exercise slightly less excruciating.</p>
<p>In order for this exercise to work well:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Groups must be physically separated to reduce audio cross-talk
between their recordings. In practice, this means 2-3 groups in a
normal-sized classroom, with the rest using nearby breakout spaces,
coffee lounges, offices, or (on one occasion) a janitor&apos;s storage
closet.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Do all three recordings before reviewing any of them, because
otherwise the person to go last is short-changed on time.</p>
</li>
<li><p>People must give feedback on themselves, as well as giving feedback
on each other, so that they can calibrate their impressions of their
own teaching according to the impressions of other people. (We find
that most people are harder on themselves than others are, and it&apos;s
important for them to realize this.)</p>
</li>
<li><p>At the end of day 1, ask trainees to review the lesson episode you
will use for the <a href="GLOSSARY.html#live-coding" class="glossary-term" title="The act of teaching programming by writing software in front of
learners as the lesson progresses.">live coding</a> demonstration at the start of day 2.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Try to make at least one mistake during the demonstration of live
coding so that trainees can see you talk through diagnosis and
recovery, and draw attention afterward to the fact that you did
this.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The announcement of this exercise is often greeted with groans and
apprehension, since few people enjoy seeing or hearing themselves.
However, it is consistently rated as one of the most valuable parts of
the class, and also serves as an ice breaker: we want pairs of
instructors at actual workshops to give one another feedback, and
that&apos;s much easier to do once they&apos;ve had some practice and have a
rubric to follow.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Setting Up Your Teaching Environment</strong></p>
<p>If the room setup allows it, try to <a href="practices.html#setting-up-your-own-environment">set up your
environment</a> to mimic
what you would use in an actual classroom: have a glass of water
handy, stand instead of sitting, and so on.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="challenges">Challenges</h2>
<h3 id="give-feedback">Give Feedback</h3>
<ol>
<li><p>Watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ApVt04rB4U" target="_blank">this video</a> as a group and then give
feedback on it. Organize feedback along two axes: positive
vs. negative and content vs. presentation.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Have each person in the class add one point to a 2x2 grid on a
whiteboard (or in the shared notes) without duplicating any points
that are already up there.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>What did other people see that you missed?  What did they think that
you strongly agree or disagree with?</p>
<h3 id="practice-giving-feedback">Practice Giving Feedback</h3>
<p>Use the process described <a href="#how-to-practice-teaching">above</a> to
practice teaching in groups of three.  When your group is done, the
instructor will add one point of feedback from each participant to a
2x2 grid on the whiteboard or in the shared notes, without accepting
duplicates.  Participants should not say whether the point they offer
was made by them, about them, or neither: the goal at this stage is
primarily for people to become comfortable with giving and receiving
