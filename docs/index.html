<blockquote>
<p><strong>The Short Version</strong></p>
<p><em>A Brief Introduction to Teaching</em> shows readers how to build and
deliver high-quality learning experiences to adults.  It is based on
<a href="http://software-carpentry.org" target="_blank">Software Carpentry</a>&apos;s <a href="https://swcarpentry.github.io/instructor-training/" target="_blank">instructor training
course</a>, and all material is available under the

</blockquote>
<p>Thousands of grassroots &quot;learn to code&quot; groups have sprung up in the
past few years.  They exist so that people don&apos;t have to figure out
how to program on their own, but ironically, that&apos;s exactly what most
of their founders are doing when it comes to teaching.</p>
<p>As many have discovered, there&apos;s more to teaching than talking.  Good
teachers break subjects up into digestible pieces, design lessons with
verifiable goals in mind, check their students&apos; progress at short
intervals, and encourage collaboration and improvisation.  Like good
programming practices, these don&apos;t have to be reinvented by every
teacher: they can and should be taught and learned.  And while these
practices won&apos;t magically make someone a <em>great</em> teacher, they do make
most people <em>better</em> teachers.</p>
<p>This book is a brief introduction to modern evidence-based teaching
practices and how to use them to teach programming to free-range
learners.  It covers:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>how people&apos;s thinking changes as they go from being novices to
competent practitioners and then to being experts;</p>
</li>
<li><p>how to tell if your learners are keeping up with you, and what to
do or say when they&apos;re not;</p>
</li>
<li><p>how to design and improve lessons efficiently and collaboratively;</p>
</li>
<li><p>how and why <a href="live">live coding</a> (i.e., writing programs step by
step in front of learners) is a better way to teach programming
than lectures or self-directed practice; and</p>
</li>
<li><p>how insights and techniques borrowed from the performing arts can
make you a better teacher.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-to-use-this-material">How to Use This Material</h2>
<p>This material has been taught as a multi-week online class, as a
two-day in-person class, and as a two-day class in which the learners
are in co-located groups and the instructor participates remotely.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Terminology</strong></p>
<p>When we talk about workshops, we will try to be clear about whether
we&apos;re discussing ones whose subject is programming, and which are
aimed at general learners, and those whose subject is now to teach
(and are using this material).  We usually refer to the latter as
&quot;instructor training workshops&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="in-person">In-Person</h3>
<p>In our experience, this is the most effective way to deliver an
instructor training workshop.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Participants are physically together for one or two days.  When they
need to work in small groups (e.g., for practice teaching), some
or all of them go to nearby breakout spaces.  Participants bring
their own tablets or laptops to view and edit online material
during the class, and use pen and paper and/or whiteboards for
some exercises.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Participants use Etherpad or Google Doc for in-person training, both
for <a href="practices.html#take-notes-together">shared note-taking</a> and for
posting exercise solutions and feedback on recorded lessons.
Questions and discussion are done aloud.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Several times during the training, participants are put in groups of
three to teach for 2-3 minutes.  The mechanics are described
<a href="performance.html#how-to-practice-teaching">later</a>, and while
participants are initially intimidated at first, they routinely
rank it as the most useful part of the class.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="two-day-online-with-groups">Two-Day Online With Groups</h3>
<p>In this format, learners are in groups of 4-12, but those groups are
geographically distributed.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Each class uses an Etherpad or Google Doc for <a href="practices.html#take-notes-together">shared
note-taking</a>, and more
importantly for asking and answering questions: having several
dozen people try to talk on a call works poorly, so in most
sessions, the instructor does the talking and learners respond
through the note-taking tool&apos;s chat.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Each group of learners is together in a room using one camera and
microphone, rather than each being on the call separately. We have
found that having good audio matters more than having good video,
and that the better the audio, the more learners can communicate
with the instructor and other rooms by voice rather than by using
the Etherpad chat.</p>
</li>
<li><p>We do the video lecture exercise as in the two-day in-person training.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="multi-week-online">Multi-Week Online</h3>
<p>This was the first format we used, and we no longer recommend it.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>We met every week or every second week for an hour via web
conferencing. Each meeting was held twice (or even three times) to
accommodate learners&apos; time zones and because video conferencing
systems can&apos;t handle 60+ people at once.</p>
</li>
<li><p>We used web conferencing and shared note-taking as described above
for online group classes.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Learners posted homework online between classes, and commented on
each other&apos;s work.  (In practice, comments were relatively rare:
people seemed to prefer to discuss material in the web chats.)</p>
</li>
<li><p>We used a WordPress blog for the first ten rounds of training, then
a GitHub-backed blog, and finally Piazza.  WordPress worked best:
setting up accounts was tedious, but everything after that ran
smoothly.  Using a GitHub blog worked so poorly that we didn&apos;t try
it again: a third of the participants found it extremely
frustrating, and post-publication commentary was awkward.  Piazza
was better than GitHub, but still not as easy for participants to
pick up as WordPress. In particular, it was hard to find things
once there were more than a dozen homework categories.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p>I started teaching people how to program in the late 1980s.  At first,
I went too fast, used too much jargon, and had little idea of how much
my learners actually understood.  I got better over time&#x2013;at least, I
thought I did&#x2013;but still had no idea how effective I was compared to
other teachers.</p>
<p>In 2010, I rebooted a project called <a href="http://software-carpentry.org" target="_blank">Software Carpentry</a>.
Its aim was (and is) to teach basic computing skills to researchers
from a wide range of disciplines so that they could get more done in
less time and with less pain.  In the two years that followed, I
discovered resources like Mark Guzdial&apos;s blog
[<a href="biblio.html#guzdial-blog">Guzdial2017</a>] and the book <em>How Learning
Works</em> [<a href="biblio.html#ambrose-hlw">Ambrose2010</a>].  These led me to other
sources like [<a href="biblio.html#lemov-champion">Lemov2014</a>],
[<a href="biblio.html#huston-dont-know">Huston2009</a>], and
[<a href="biblio.html#green-babt">Green2014</a>] that showed me what I could do to
make my teaching better, and why I should believe it would work.</p>
<p>We started using these ideas in <a href="http://software-carpentry.org" target="_blank">Software Carpentry</a> in
2012, and the results were everything we&apos;d hoped for.  Designing
lessons with different stage of cognitive development in mind, using
live coding instead of slides, and adopting lightweight real-time
assessment mechanisms (most involving sticky notes) all made our
workshops more effective.</p>
<p>What made the biggest difference, though, was offering a short course
to introduce people to these techniques and the ideas behind them.
This course was originally delivered online over multiple weeks, but
by 2014 we were teaching it in two intensive days (just like our
regular software skills workshops).  Over the last three years, I have
run more than forty versions of that course for people who want to
teach programming to children, recent immigrants, women re-entering
the workforce, and a wide variety of other groups.  Those experiences
are the basis of this book.</p>

<h2 id="who-you-are">Who You Are</h2>
<p><a href="lessons#learner-profiles">Learner Profiles</a> will explain how to
define who a class is for.  Here, we present profiles of two typical
participants in a workshop based on this book.</p>
<p><strong>Samira</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><p>An undergraduate student in mechanical engineering who first
encountered the subject in an after-school club for girls and
would now like to pass on her love for it.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Has done one programming class and one robotics class, and was a
lab assistant for a couple of weekend introductions to engineering
for high school students at her university.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Would like to learn techniques for explaining ideas and handling
unexpected questions or situations.</p>
</li>
<li><p>This workshop will introduce her to some basic classroom practices
and give her a chance to try them out in front of a supportive
audience.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Feels insecure about standing up and teaching a subject that she
isn&apos;t an expert in (&quot;I&apos;m not a professor!&quot;).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Moshe</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><p>A professional programmer with two young children.  Their school
doesn&apos;t offer a programming class, so he has volunteered to put
one together.  After reading a dozen different &quot;programming for
kids&quot; books, he feels more confused than ever.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Has been programming in Visual Basic and C# for almost twenty
years, during which time he has frequently given presentations to
colleagues and management.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Wants to learn how to build lessons that both he and other people
can use and maintain.</p>
</li>
<li><p>This class will show him how to design and deliver lessons
tailored for his students, how to tell how well those lessons are
working, and how to keep those lessons up to date.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Moshe is partially deaf, and most of his students have hearing
disabilities as well.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="teaching-practices">Teaching Practices</h2>
<p>We suggest that instructor training workshops use these three teaching
practices right from the start:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Have a <a href="practices#conduct">code of conduct</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="practices#notes">Take notes together</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="practices#assess">Pre-assess</a> learners&apos; motivation and prior
knowledge.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="dedication">Dedication</h2>
<p>This book is dedicated to my mother, Doris Wilson, who taught a lot of
children how to read and write, and to believe in themselves.</p>
<h2 id="challenges">Challenges</h2>
