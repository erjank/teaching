Short Version\nA Brief Introduction to Teaching shows readers how to build and\ndeliver high-quality learning experiences to adults.  It is based on\nSoftware Carpentry's instructor training\ncourse, and all material is available under the\nCreative Commons - Attribution license.\n\nThousands of grassroots \"learn to code\" groups have sprung up in the\npast few years.  They exist so that people don't have to figure out\nhow to program on their own, but ironically, that's exactly what most\nof their founders are doing when it comes to teaching.\nAs many have discovered, there's more to teaching than talking.  Good\nteachers break subjects up into digestible pieces, design lessons with\nverifiable goals in mind, check their students' progress at short\nintervals, and encourage collaboration and improvisation.  Like good\nprogramming practices, these don't have to be reinvented by every\nteacher: they can and should be taught and learned.  And while these\npractices won't magically make someone a great teacher, they do make\nmost people better teachers.\nThis book is a brief introduction to modern evidence-based teaching\npractices and how to use them to teach programming to free-range\nlearners.  It covers:\n\nhow people's thinking changes as they go from being novices to\ncompetent practitioners and then to being experts;\n\nhow to tell if your learners are keeping up with you, and what to\ndo or say when they're not;\n\nhow to design and improve lessons efficiently and collaboratively;\n\nhow and why live coding (i.e., writing programs step by\nstep in front of learners) is a better way to teach programming\nthan lectures or self-directed practice; and\n\nhow insights and techniques borrowed from the performing arts can\nmake you a better teacher.\n\n\nHow to Use This Material\nThis material has been taught as a multi-week online class, as a\ntwo-day in-person class, and as a two-day class in which the learners\nare in co-located groups and the instructor participates remotely.\n\nTerminology\nWhen we talk about workshops, we will try to be clear about whether\nwe're discussing ones whose subject is programming, and which are\naimed at general learners, and those whose subject is now to teach\n(and are using this material).  We usually refer to the latter as\n\"instructor training workshops\".\n\nIn-Person\nIn our experience, this is the most effective way to deliver an\ninstructor training workshop.\n\nParticipants are physically together for one or two days.  When they\nneed to work in small groups (e.g., for practice teaching), some\nor all of them go to nearby breakout spaces.  Participants bring\ntheir own tablets or laptops to view and edit online material\nduring the class, and use pen and paper and/or whiteboards for\nsome exercises.\n\nParticipants use Etherpad or Google Doc for in-person training, both\nfor shared note-taking and for\nposting exercise solutions and feedback on recorded lessons.\nQuestions and discussion are done aloud.\n\nSeveral times during the training, participants are put in groups of\nthree to teach for 2-3 minutes.  The mechanics are described\nlater, and while\nparticipants are initially intimidated at first, they routinely\nrank it as the most useful part of the class.\n\n\nTwo-Day Online With Groups\nIn this format, learners are in groups of 4-12, but those groups are\ngeographically distributed.\n\nEach class uses an Etherpad or Google Doc for shared\nnote-taking, and more\nimportantly for asking and answering questions: having several\ndozen people try to talk on a call works poorly, so in most\nsessions, the instructor does the talking and learners respond\nthrough the note-taking tool's chat.\n\nEach group of learners is together in a room using one camera and\nmicrophone, rather than each being on the call separately. We have\nfound that having good audio matters more than having good video,\nand that the better the audio, the more learners can communicate\nwith the instructor and other rooms by voice rather than by using\nthe Etherpad chat.\n\nWe do the video lecture exercise as in the two-day in-person training.\n\n\nMulti-Week Online\nThis was the first format we used, and we no longer recommend it.\n\nWe met every week or every second week for an hour via web\nconferencing. Each meeting was held twice (or even three times) to\naccommodate learners' time zones and because video conferencing\nsystems can't handle 60+ people at once.\n\nWe used web conferencing and shared note-taking as described above\nfor online group classes.\n\nLearners posted homework online between classes, and commented on\neach other's work.  (In practice, comments were relatively rare:\npeople seemed to prefer to discuss material in the web chats.)\n\nWe used a WordPress blog for the first ten rounds of training, then\na GitHub-backed blog, and finally Piazza.  WordPress worked best:\nsetting up accounts was tedious, but everything after that ran\nsmoothly.  Using a GitHub blog worked so poorly that we didn't try\nit again: a third of the participants found it extremely\nfrustrating, and post-publication commentary was awkward.  Piazza\nwas better than GitHub, but still not as easy for participants to\npick up as WordPress. In particular, it was hard to find things\nonce there were more than a dozen homework categories.\n\n\nHistory\nI started teaching people how to program in the late 1980s.  At first,\nI went too fast, used too much jargon, and had little idea of how much\nmy learners actually understood.  I got better over time–at least, I\nthought I did–but still had no idea how effective I was compared to\nother teachers.\nIn 2010, I rebooted a project called Software Carpentry.\nIts aim was (and is) to teach basic computing skills to researchers\nfrom a wide range of disciplines so that they could get more done in\nless time and with less pain.  In the two years that followed, I\ndiscovered resources like Mark Guzdial's blog\n[Guzdial2017] and the book How Learning\nWorks [Ambrose2010].  These led me to other\nsources like [Lemov2014],\n[Huston2009], and\n[Green2014] that showed me what I could do to\nmake my teaching better, and why I should believe it would work.\nWe started using these ideas in Software Carpentry in\n2012, and the results were everything we'd hoped for.  Designing\nlessons with different stage of cognitive development in mind, using\nlive coding instead of slides, and adopting lightweight real-time\nassessment mechanisms1 all made our workshops more effective.\nWhat made the biggest difference, though, was offering a short course\nto introduce people to these techniques and the ideas behind them.\nThis course was originally delivered online over multiple weeks, but\nby 2014 we were teaching it in two intensive days (just like our\nregular software skills workshops).  Over the last three years, I have\nrun more than forty versions of that course for people who want to\nteach programming to children, recent immigrants, women re-entering\nthe workforce, and a wide variety of other groups.  Those experiences\nare the basis of this book.\nAcknowledgments\nI am grateful to everyone who helped create Software Carpentry's\ninstructor training course, including Erin Becker, Karen Cranston,\nNeal Davis, Rayna Harris, Kate Hertweck, Christina Koch, Sue\nMcClatchy, Lex Nederbragt, Elizabeth Patitsas, Aleksandra Pawlik,\nAriel Rokem, Tracy Teal, Fiona Tweedie, Allegra Via, Anelda van der\nWalt, Belinda Weaver, Jason Williams, and the hundreds of people who\nhave gone through it over the years.  I am also grateful to Neil\nBrown, Warren Code, and Mark Degani for their feedback on this\nversion.  If you find it useful, I hope you will pass on whatever you\nlearn to someone else.\nWho You Are\nLearner Profiles will explain how to\ndefine who a class is for.  Here, we present profiles of two typical\nparticipants in a workshop based on this book.\nSamira\n\nAn undergraduate student in mechanical engineering who first\nencountered the subject in an after-school club for girls and\nwould now like to pass on her love for it.\n\nHas done one programming class and one robotics class, and was a\nlab assistant for a couple of weekend introductions to engineering\nfor high school students at her university.\n\nWould like to learn techniques for explaining ideas and handling\nunexpected questions or situations.\n\nThis workshop will introduce her to some basic classroom practices\nand give her a chance to try them out in front of a supportive\naudience.\n\nFeels insecure about standing up and teaching a subject that she\nisn't an expert in (\"I'm not a professor!\").\n\n\nMoshe\n\nA professional programmer with two young children.  Their school\ndoesn't offer a programming class, so he has volunteered to put\none together.  After reading a dozen different \"programming for\nkids\" books, he feels more confused than ever.\n\nHas been programming in Visual Basic and C# for almost twenty\nyears, during which time he has frequently given presentations to\ncolleagues and management.\n\nWants to learn how to build lessons that both he and other people\ncan use and maintain.\n\nThis class will show him how to design and deliver lessons\ntailored for his students, how to tell how well those lessons are\nworking, and how to keep those lessons up to date.\n\nMoshe is partially deaf, and most of his students have hearing\ndisabilities as well.\n\n\nTeaching Practices\nWe suggest that instructor training workshops use these three teaching\npractices right from the start:\n\nHave a code of conduct.\n\nTake notes together.\n\nPre-assess learners' motivation and prior\nknowledge.\n\n\nDedication\nThis book is dedicated to my mother, Doris Wilson, who taught a lot of\nchildren how to read and write, and to believe in themselves.\nChallenges\nFavorite Class\nIn the online notes, write down your name, the best class you ever\ntook, and what made it so great.\n10 minutes\n\nFootnotes\n\n1.

Our approach is based on the [Dreyfus model of\nskill acquisition][wikipedia-dreyfus], and more specifically on the\nwork of researchers like Patricia Benner, who studied how nurses\nprogress from being novices to being experts\n[Benner2000].  Benner identified five\nstages of cognitive development that most people go through in a\nfairly consistent way.  (We say \"most\" and \"fairly\" because human\nbeings are variable, and there will always be outliers.  However, that\nshouldn't prevent us from making strong statements about what's true\nfor the majority.)\nFor our purposes, we simplify the five stages to three:\n\nA novice is someone who doesn't know what\nthey don't know, i.e., they don't yet know what the key ideas in\nthe domain are or how they relate. They reason by analogy and\nguesswork, borrowing bits and pieces of their mental models of\nother domains which seem superficially similar1.\n\nA competent practitioner\nis someone who has a mental model that's good enough for everyday\npurposes: they can do normal tasks with normal effort under normal\ncircumstances. This model does not have to be completely accurate\nin order to be useful: for example, the average driver's mental\nmodel of how a car works probably doesn't include most of the\ncomplexities that a mechanical engineer would be concerned with.\n\nAn expert is someone who can easily handle\nsituations that are out of the ordinary, diagnose the causes of\nproblems, and so on. We will discuss expertise in more detail in\nMemory.\n\n\nOne example of a mental model is the ball-and-spring model of\nmolecules that most of us encountered in high school chemistry. Atoms\naren't actually balls, and their bonds aren't actually springs, but\nthe model does a good job of helping people reason about chemical\ncompounds and their reactions.  Another model of an atom has a small\ncentral ball (the nucleus) surrounded by orbiting electrons.  Again,\nthis model is wrong, but useful for many purposes.\nNovices, competent practitioners, and experts need to be taught\ndifferently.  In particular, presenting novices with a pile of facts\nearly on is counter-productive, because they don't yet have a model to\nfit those facts into.  In fact, presenting too many facts too soon can\nactually reinforce the incorrect mental model they've cobbled\ntogether.  As Derek Muller\nwrote\nabout this in the context of video instruction for science students:\n\nStudents have existing ideas about scientific phenomena before\nviewing a video. If the video presents scientific concepts in a\nclear, well illustrated way, students believe they are learning but\nthey do not engage with the media on a deep enough level to realize\nthat what was is presented differs from their prior knowledge.\nThere is hope, however. Presenting students' common misconceptions\nin a video alongside the scientific concepts has been shown to\nincrease learning by increasing the amount of mental effort students\nexpend while watching it.\n\nThe goal with novices is therefore to help them construct a working\nmental model so that they have somewhere to put facts.  As an example\nof what this means in practice, Software Carpentry's lesson on the\nUnix shell introduces fifteen commands in three\nhours. Twelve minutes per command may seem glacially slow, but the\nlesson's real purpose isn't to teach those fifteen commands: it's to\nteach learners about paths, history, tab completion, wildcards, pipes\nand filters, command-line arguments, redirection, and all the other\nbig ideas that the shell depends on.  Once they understand those\nconcepts, people can quickly learn a repertoire of commands.  What's\nmore, later lessons on how to build functions in a programming\nlanguage can refer back to pipes and filters, which helps solidify\nboth ideas.\n\nDifferent Kinds of Lessons\nThe cognitive differences between novices and competent\npractitioners underpin the differences between two kinds of teaching\nmaterials. A tutorial's purpose is to help newcomers to a field\nbuild a mental model; a manual's role, on the other hand, is to help\ncompetent practitioners fill in the gaps in their\nknowledge. Tutorials frustrate competent practitioners because they\nmove too slowly and say things that are obvious (though of course\nthey are anything but to newcomers). Equally, manuals frustrate\nnovices because they use jargon and don't explain things. One of\nthe reasons Unix and C became popular is that Kernighan et al's\ntrilogy [Kernighan1982],\n[Kernighan1984],\n[Kernighan1988] somehow managed to be\ngood tutorials and good manuals at the same time. Ray and Ray's\nbook on Unix [Ray2014] and Fehily's\nintroduction to SQL [Fehily2008] are among the\nvery few other books in computing that have accomplished this.\n\nOne of the challenges in building a mental model is to clear away\nthings that don't belong.  As Mark Twain said, \"It ain't what\nyou don't know that gets you into trouble. It's what you know for sure\nthat just ain't so.\"\nBroadly speaking, learners' misconceptions fall into three categories:\n\nSimple factual errors, such as believing that Vancouver is the\ncapital of British Columbia2. These are simple to correct, but\ngetting the facts right is not enough on its own.\n\nBroken models, such as believing that motion and acceleration\nmust be in the same direction. We can address these by having them\nreason through examples to see contradictions.\n\nFundamental beliefs, such as \"the world is only a few thousand\nyears old\" or \"some kinds of people are just naturally better at\nprogramming than others\"\n[Patitsas2016].  These are often\ndeeply connected to the learner's social identity, and so are\nresistant to evidence and cannot be reasoned away in class.\n\n\nFormative Assessment\nTeaching is most effective when instructors have a way to identify and\nclear up learners' misconceptions while they are teaching.  The\ntechnical term for this is formative\nassessment, which is assessment\nthat takes place during the lesson in order to form or shape it.\nLearners don't pass or fail formative assessments; instead, its main\npurpose is to tell both the instructor and the learner how the learner\nis doing, and what to focus on next.  For example, a music teacher\nmight ask a student to play a scale very slowly in order to see\nwhether she is breathing correctly, and if she is not, what she should\nchange.\nThe counterpoint to formative assessment is summative\nassessment, which is used at the\nend of the lesson to tell whether the desired learning took place and\nwhether the learner is ready to move on3.  Learners either pass or\nfail a summative assessment. One example is a driving exam, which\nreassures the rest of society that someone can safely be allowed on\nthe road.\n\nConnecting Formative and Summative Assessment\nOne rule to use when designing lessons is that formative assessments\nshould prepare people for summative assessments: no one should ever\nencounter a question on an exam for which the teaching did not\nprepare them.  This doesn't mean that novel problems should not\nappear, but that if they do, learners should have have practice with\nand feedback on tackling novel problems beforehand.\n\nIn order to be useful during teaching, a formative assessment has to\nbe quick to administer and give an unambiguous result. The most widely\nused kind of formative assessment is probably the multiple choice\nquestion (MCQ). When designed well, these can do much more than just\ntell whether someone knows something or not. For example, suppose we\nare teaching children multi-digit addition. A well-designed MCQ would\nbe:\n\nQ: what is 27 + 15 ?\n\n42\n32\n312\n33\n\n\nThe correct answer is 42, but each of the other answers provides\nvaluable insight:\n\nIf the child answers 32, she is throwing away the carry completely.\n\nIf she answers 312, she knows that she can't just discard the\ncarried 1, but doesn't understand that it's actually a ten and needs\nto be added into the next column. In other words, she is treating\neach column of numbers as unconnected to its neighbors.\n\nIf she answers 33 then she knows she has to carry the 1, but is\ncarrying it back into the same column it came from.\n\n\nEach of these incorrect answers is a plausible\ndistractor with diagnostic\npower.  \"Plausible\" means that it\nlooks like it could be right: instructors will often put\nsupposedly-silly answers like \"a fish!\" on MCQs, but they don't\nprovide any insight and learners actually don't find them\nfunny. \"Diagnostic power\" means that each of the distractors helps the\ninstructor figure out what to explain to that particular learner\nnext4.\nInstructors should use MCQs or some other kind of formative assessment\nat least every 10-15 minutes in order to make sure that the class is\nactually learning. Since the average attention span is usually only\nthis long, formative assessments also help break up instructional time\nand re-focus attention. Formative assessments can also be used\npreemptively: if you start a class with an MCQ and everyone can answer\nit correctly, then you can safely skip the part of the lecture in\nwhich you were going to explain something that your learners already\nknow. Doing this also helps show learners that the instructor cares\nabout how much they are learning, and respects their time enough not\nto waste it.\n\nWhen to Proceed?\nAs the instructor, what should you do if most of the class votes for\none of the wrong answers? What if the votes are evenly spread between\noptions?  The answer is, \"It depends.\"  If the majority of the class\nvotes for a single wrong answer, you should go back and work on\ncorrecting that particular misconception. If answers are pretty evenly\nsplit between options, learners are probably guessing randomly and\nit's a good idea to go back to a point where everyone was on the same\npage.\nIf most of the class votes for the right answer, but a few vote for\nwrong ones, you have to decide whether you should spend time getting\nthe minority caught up, or whether it's more important to keep the\nmajority engaged.  This is just one example of one of the most\nimportant rules of teaching: no matter how hard you work, or what\nteaching practices you use, you won't always be able to give everyone\nthe help they need.\n\n\n\nNotes on MCQ Design\n\nA good MCQ tests for conceptual misunderstanding rather than\nsimple factual knowledge. If you are having a hard time coming\nup with diagnostic distractors, then either you need to think\nmore about your learners' mental models, or your question simply\nisn't a good starting point for an MCQ.\n\nWhen you are trying to come up with distractors, think about\nquestions that learners asked or problems they had the last time\nyou taught this subject. If you haven't taught it before, think\nabout your own misconceptions or ask colleagues about their\nexperiences.  You can also ask open-ended questions in one class\nto collect misconceptions about material to be covered in a\nlater class.\n\n\n\n\n\nConcept Inventories\nThe Force Concept Inventory is a set of MCQs\ndesigned to gauge understanding of basic Newtonian mechanics. By\ninterviewing a large number of respondents, correlating their\nmisconceptions with patterns of right and wrong answers to\nquestions, and then improving the questions, it's possible to\nconstruct a very precise diagnostic tool. However, it's very costly\nto do this, and students' ability to search for answers on the\ninternet is an ever-increasing threat to its validity.\n\n\n\nWe Know Less Than We Think\n[Brown2014] compared teachers' opinions\nabout common programming errors with data from over 100,000\nstudents, and finds only weak consensus amongst teachers and between\nteachers and data.\n\nDesigning an MCQ with plausible distractors is useful even if it is\nnever used in class because it forces the instructor to think about\nthe learners' mental models and how they might be broken–in short,\nto put themselves into the learners' heads and see the topic from\ntheir point of view.\n\nWhy Not MOOCs\nIf you use robots to teach, you teach people to be robots.– variously attributed\nMassive open online courses (MOOCs) in which students watch videos\ninstead of attending lectures, and then do assignments that are\n(usually) robo-graded, were a hot topic a few years ago.  Now that\nthe hype has worn off, though, it's clear that they aren't as\neffective as their more enthusiastic proponents claimed they would\nbe [Ubell2017].\nRecorded content is ineffective for most novices learners because it\ncannot intervene to clear up specific learners' misconceptions. Some\npeople happen to already have the right conceptual categories for a\nsubject, or happen to form them correctly early on; these are the\nones who stick with most massive online courses, but many\ndiscussions of the effectiveness of such courses ignore this\nsurvivor bias.\n\nTeaching Practices\nIf you haven't done so already, you should start using these three\nteaching practices in your instructor training workshop:\n\nUse sticky notes as status flags\n\nUse sticky notes to distribute attention\n\nUse sticky notes as minute cards\n\n\nChallenges\nYour Mental Models\nWhat is one mental model you use to frame and understand your work?\nWrite a few sentences describing it in the shared notes, and give\nfeedback on other learners' contributions.\n5 minutes\nSymptoms of Being a Novice\nWhat are the symptoms of being a novice?  I.e., what does someone do\nor say that leads you to classify them as a novice in some domain?\n5 minutes\nModelling Novice Mental Models\nCreate a multiple choice question related to a topic you intend to teach\nand explain the diagnostic power of each its distractors (i.e., what\nmisconception each distractor is meant to identify).\nWhen you are done, give your MCQ to a partner, and have a look at\ntheirs.  Is the question ambiguous?  Are the misconceptions plausible?\nDo the distractors actually test for them?  Are any likely\nmisconceptions not tested for?\n20 minutes\nOther Kinds of Formative Assessment\nA good formative assessment requires people to think through a\nproblem.  For example, consider this question from\n[Epstein2002].  Imagine that you\nhave placed a cake of ice in a bathtub and then filled the tub to the\nrim with water. When the ice melts, does the water level go up (so\nthat the tub overflows), go down, or stay the same?\nThe correct answer is that the level stays the same: the ice displaces\nits own weight in water, so it exactly fills the \"hole\" it has made\nwhen it melts.  Figuring this out why helps people build a model of\nthe relationship between weight, volume, and density.\nDescribe another kind of formative assessment you have seen or used and\nexplain how it helps both the instructor and the learner figure out\nwhere they are and what they need to do next.\n20 minutes\n\nFootnotes\n\n1. One sign that someone is a novice is that the things they say aren't even wrong, e.g., they think there's a difference between programs they type in character by character and identical ones that they have copied and pasted.

From politicians\nto researchers and teachers themselves, reformers have designed\nsystems to find and promote those who can teach and eliminate those\nwho can't. But as Elizabeth Green explains in\n[Green2014], that assumption is wrong, which is\nwhy educational reforms based on it have repeatedly failed.\nThe book is written as a history of the people who have put that\npuzzle together in the US. Its core begins with a discussion of what\nJames Stigler discovered during a visit to Japan in the early 1990s:\n\nSome American teachers called their pattern \"I, We, You\": After\nchecking homework, teachers announced the day's topic, demonstrating\na new procedure (I)… Then they led the class in trying out a\nsample problem together (We)… Finally, they let students work\nthrough similar problems on their own, usually by silently making\ntheir way through a worksheet (You)…\nThe Japanese teachers, meanwhile, turned \"I, We, You\" inside\nout. You might call their version \"You, Y'all, We.\" They began not\nwith an introduction, but a single problem that students spent ten\nor twenty minutes working through alone (You)… While the\nstudents worked, the teacher wove through the students' desks,\nstudying what they came up with and taking notes to remember who had\nwhich idea. Sometimes the teacher then deployed the students to\ndiscuss the problem in small groups (Y'all). Next, the teacher\nbrought them back to the whole group, asking students to present\ntheir different ideas for how to solve the problem on the\nchalkboard… Finally, the teacher led a discussion, guiding\nstudents to a shared conclusion (We).\n\nIt's tempting but wrong to think that this particular teaching\ntechnique is some kind of secret sauce. The actual key is a practice\ncalled jugyokenkyu, which means \"lesson\nstudy\":\n\nJugyokenkyu is a bucket of practices that Japanese teachers use to\nhone their craft, from observing each other at work to discussing\nthe lesson afterward to studying curriculum materials with\ncolleagues. The practice is so pervasive in Japanese schools that it\nis…effectively invisible.\nIn order to graduate, [Japanese] education majors not only had to\nwatch their assigned master teacher work, they had to effectively\nreplace him, installing themselves in his classroom first as\nobservers and then, by the third week, as a wobbly…approximation of\nthe teacher himself.  It worked like a kind of teaching relay. Each\ntrainee took a subject, planning five days' worth of lessons… [and\nthen] each took a day. To pass the baton, you had to teach a day's\nlesson in every single subject: the one you planned and the four you\ndid not… and you had to do it right under your master teacher's\nnose. Afterward, everyone–the teacher, the college students, and\nsometimes even another outside observer–would sit around a formal\ntable to talk about what they saw.\n\nPutting work under a microscope in order to improve it is commonplace\nin sports and music.  A professional musician, for example, will\ndissect half a dozen different recordings of \"Body and Soul\" or\n\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" before performing it. They would also expect\nto get feedback from fellow musicians during practice and after\nperformances.  Many other disciplines work this way too: the Japanese\ndrew inspiration from Deming's ideas on continuous improvement in\nmanufacturing, while the adoption of code review\nover the last 15 years has done more to improve everyday programming\nthan any number of books or websites.\nBut this kind of feedback isn't part of teaching culture in the US,\nthe UK, Canada, or Australia.  There, what happens in the classroom\nstays in the classroom: teachers don't watch each other's lessons on a\nregular basis, so they can't borrow each other's good ideas. The\nresult is that every teacher has to invent teaching on their\nown. They may get lesson plans and assignments from colleagues, the\nschool board, a textbook publisher, or the Internet, but each teacher\nhas to figure out on their own how to combine that with the theory\nthey've learned in education school to deliver an actual lesson in an\nactual classroom for actual students.\nDemonstration lessons, in which one teacher is in front of a room full\nof students while other teachers observe, seem like a way to solve\nthis.  However, Fincher and her colleagues studied how teaching\npractices are actually transferred using both a detailed case study\n[Fincher2007] and analysis of\nchange stories [Fincher2012].  The\nabstract of the latter paper sums up their findings:\n\nInnovative tools and teaching practices often fail to be adopted by\neducators in the field, despite evidence of their effectiveness.\nNaïve models of educational change assume this lack of adoption\narises from failure to properly disseminate promising work, but\nevidence suggests that dissemination via publication is simply not\neffective… We asked educators to describe changes they had made to\ntheir teaching practice… Of the 99 change stories analyzed, only\nthree demonstrate an active search for new practices or materials on\nthe part of teachers, and published materials were consulted in just\neight… Most of the changes occurred locally, without input from\noutside sources, or involved only personal interaction with other\neducators.\n\nBarker et al found something similar\n[Barker2015]:\n\nAdoption is not a \"rational action,\" however, but an iterative\nseries of decisions made in a social context, relying on normative\ntraditions, social cueing, and emotional or intuitive processes…\nFaculty are not likely to use educational research findings as the\nbasis for adoption decisions… Positive student feedback is taken as\nstrong evidence by faculty that they should continue a practice.\n\nThis phenomenon is sometimes called lateral knowledge\ntransfer: someone sets out\nto teach X, but while watching them, their audience actually learns Y\nas well (or instead). For example, an instructor might set out to show\npeople how to do a particular statistical analysis in R, but what her\nlearners might take away is some new keyboard shortcuts in R\nStudio. Live coding makes this much more likely because it allows\nlearners to see the \"how\" as well as the \"what\", and jugyokenkyu\nworks because it creates more opportunities for this to happen.\nFeedback\n\nAs the cartoon above suggests, sometimes it can be hard to receive\nfeedback, especially negative feedback.  The process is easier and\nmore productive when the people involved share ground rules and\nexpectations. This is especially important when they have different\nbackgrounds or cultural expectations about what's appropriate to say\nand what isn't.\nYou can get better feedback on your work from other people using\ntechniques like these:\n\nInitiate feedback. It's better to ask for feedback than to\nreceive it unwillingly.\n\nChoose your own questions, i.e., ask for specific\nfeedback. It's a lot harder for someone to answer, \"What do you\nthink?\" than to answer either, \"What is one thing I could have\ndone as an instructor to make this lesson more effective?\"  or \"If\nyou could pick one thing from the lesson to go over again, what\nwould it be?\"\nDirecting feedback like this is also more helpful to you.  It's\nalways better to try to fix one thing at once than to change\neverything and hope it's for the better.  Directing feedback at\nsomething you have chosen to work on helps you stay focused, which\nin turn increases the odds that you'll see progress.\n\nUse a feedback translator. Have a fellow instructor (or other\ntrusted person in the room) read over all the feedback and give an\nexecutive summary. It can be easier to hear \"It sounds like most\npeople are following, so you could speed up\" than to read several\nnotes all saying, \"this is too slow\" or \"this is boring\".\n\nMost importantly, be kind to yourself.  Many of us are very\ncritical of ourselves, so it's always helpful to jot down what we\nthought of ourselves before getting feedback from others.\nThat allows us to compare what we think of our performance with what\nothers think, which in turn allows us to scale the former more\naccurately.  For example, it's very common for people to think that\nthey're saying \"um\" and \"err\" all the time, when their audience\ndoesn't notice it.  Getting that feedback once allows instructors to\nadjust their assessment of themselves the next time they feel that\nway.\n\n\nYou can give feedback to others more effectively as well:\n\nBalance positive and negative feedback. One method is a\n\"compliment sandwiches\" made up of one positive, one negative, and\na second positive observation.\n\nOrganize your feedback using a rubric. Most people are more\ncomfortable giving and receiving feedback when they they feel that\nunderstand the social rules governing what they are allowed to say\nand how they are allowed to say it.  A facilitator can then\ntranscribe items into a shared document (or onto a whiteboard)\nduring discussion.\n\n\n\nTwo by Two\nThe rubric we find most useful for feedback on teaching is a 2x2\ngrid whose vertical axis is labelled \"positive\" and \"negative\", and\nwhose horizontal axis is labelled \"content\" (what was said) and\n\"presentation (how it was said).  Observers write each of their\ncomments in one of the grid's four squares as they are watching the\ndemonstration.\n\nWhatever methods are used, the most important thing to remember is\nfeedback on teaching is meant to be formative: its goal is to help\npeople figure out what they are doing well and what they still need to\nwork on.\n\nStudio Classes\nArchitecture schools often include studio classes, in which students\nsolve small design problems and get feedback from their peers right\nthen and there.  These classes are most effective when the\ninstructor critiques both the designs and the peer critiques, so\nthat participants are learning not only how to make buildings, but\nhow to give and get feedback\n[Schon1984].  Master classes in music\nserve a similar purpose, and a few people have experimented with\nusing live coding at conferences or online in similar ways.\n\n\n\nTells\nEveryone has nervous habits. For example, many of us become \"Mickey\nMouse\" versions of ourselves when we're nervous, i.e., we talk more\nrapidly than usual, in a higher-pitched voice, and wave our arms\naround more than we usually would.\nGamblers call nervous habits like this \"tells\".  While these are\noften not as noticeable as you would think, it's good to know\nwhether you pace, fiddle with your hair, look at your shoes, or\nrattle the change in your pocket when you don't know the answer\nto a question.\nYou can't get rid of tells completely, and trying to do so can make\nyou obsess about them.  A better strategy is to try to displace\nthem, e.g., to train yourself to scrunch your toes inside your shoes\ninstead of cracking your knuckles.\n\nIf you are interested in knowing more about giving and getting\nfeedback, you may want to read\n[Gormally2014] and discuss ways\nyou could make peer-to-peer feedback a routine part of your teaching.\nYou may also enjoy [Gawande2011],\nwhich looks at the value of having a coach.\nHow to Practice Teaching\nOne of the key elements of instructor training is recording trainees\nand having them, and their peers, critique those recordings. We were\nintroduced to this practice by UBC's Warren Code, who learned it from\nthe Instructional Skills Workshop,\nand it has evolved to the following:\n\nSplit into groups of three.\n\nEach person rotates through the roles of instructor, audience, and\nvideographer.  As the instructor, they have two minutes to explain\none key idea from their research (or other work) as if they were\ntalking to a class of interested high school students. The person\npretending to be the audience is there to be attentive, while the\nvideographer records the session using a cellphone or similar\ndevice.\n\nAfter everyone in the group of three has finished teaching, watch the\nvideos as a group. Everyone gives feedback on all three videos, i.e.,\npeople give feedback on themselves as well as on others.\n\nAfter everyone has given feedback on all of the videos, return to the\nmain group and put all of the feedback into the notes.  Again, try to\ndivide positive from negative and content from presentation.  Try\nalso to identify each person's tells: what do they do that betrays\nnervousness, and how noticeable is it?\n\n\nIt's important to record all three videos and then watch all three: if\nthe cycle is teach-review-teach-review, the last person to teach runs\nout of time. Doing all the reviewing after all the teaching also helps\nput a bit of distance between the teaching and the reviewing, which\nmakes the exercise slightly less excruciating.\nIn order for this exercise to work well:\n\nGroups must be physically separated to reduce audio cross-talk\nbetween their recordings. In practice, this means 2-3 groups in a\nnormal-sized classroom, with the rest using nearby breakout spaces,\ncoffee lounges, offices, or (on one occasion) a janitor's storage\ncloset.\n\nDo all three recordings before reviewing any of them, because\notherwise the person to go last is short-changed on time.\n\nPeople must give feedback on themselves, as well as giving feedback\non each other, so that they can calibrate their impressions of their\nown teaching according to the impressions of other people. (We find\nthat most people are harder on themselves than others are, and it's\nimportant for them to realize this.)\n\nAt the end of day 1, ask trainees to review the lesson episode you\nwill use for the live coding demonstration at the start of day 2.\n\nTry to make at least one mistake during the demonstration of live\ncoding so that trainees can see you talk through diagnosis and\nrecovery, and draw attention afterward to the fact that you did\nthis.\n\n\nThe announcement of this exercise is often greeted with groans and\napprehension, since few people enjoy seeing or hearing themselves.\nHowever, it is consistently rated as one of the most valuable parts of\nthe class, and also serves as an ice breaker: we want pairs of\ninstructors at actual workshops to give one another feedback, and\nthat's much easier to do once they've had some practice and have a\nrubric to follow.\n\nSetting Up Your Teaching Environment\nIf the room setup allows it, try to set up your\nenvironment to mimic\nwhat you would use in an actual classroom: have a glass of water\nhandy, stand instead of sitting, and so on.\n\nChallenges\nGive Feedback\n\nWatch this video as a group and then give\nfeedback on it. Organize feedback along two axes: positive\nvs. negative and content vs. presentation.\n\nHave each person in the class add one point to a 2x2 grid on a\nwhiteboard (or in the shared notes) without duplicating any points\nthat are already up there.\n\n\nWhat did other people see that you missed?  What did they think that\nyou strongly agree or disagree with?\n20 minutes\nPractice Giving Feedback\nUse the process described above to\npractice teaching in groups of three.  When your group is done, the\ninstructor will add one point of feedback from each participant to a\n2x2 grid on the whiteboard or in the shared notes, without accepting\nduplicates.  Participants should not say whether the point they offer\nwas made by them, about them, or neither: the goal at this stage is\nprimarily for people to become comfortable with giving and receiving\nfeedback, and to establish a consensus about what sorts of things to\nlook for.\n45 minutes\n"},"memory.html":{"url":"memory.html","title":"Expertise and Memory","keywords":"","body":"Expertise and Memory\n\nObjectives\n\nLearners can define expertise and explain its operation using\na graph metaphor for cognition.\nLearners can explain the difference between repetition and\ndeliberate practice.\nLearners can define and construct concept maps, and explain\nthe benefits of externalizing cognition.\nLearners can differentiate long-term and short-term  memory,\ndescribe the capacity limits of the latter, and explain the\nthe impact of these limits on teaching.\n\n\nThe previous chapter looked at what distinguishes novices from\ncompetent practitioners.  Here, we will look at expertise: what it is,\nhow people acquire it, and how it can be harmful as well as helpful.\nWe will then see how concept maps can be used to figure out how to\nturn knowledge into lessons.\nTo start, what do we mean when we say someone is an expert?  The usual\nresponse is that they can solve problems much faster than people who\nare \"merely competent\", or that they can recognize and deal with the\ncases where the normal rules don't apply.  They also somehow make this\nlook effortless: in most cases, they just know what the right answer\nis.\nWhat makes someone an expert? The answer isn't just that they know\nmore facts: competent practitioners can memorize a lot of trivia\nwithout any noticeable improvement to their performance.  Instead,\nimagine for a moment that we store knowledge as a graph in which facts\nare nodes and relationships are arcs. (This is emphatically not how\nour brains work, but it's a useful metaphor.) The key difference\nbetween experts and people who are \"merely competent\" is that experts\nhave many more connections, i.e., their mental models are much more\ndensely connected.\nThis metaphor helps explain many observed aspects of expert behavior:\n\nExperts can jump directly from a problem to its solution because\nthere actually is a direct link between the two in their mind.\nWhere a competent practitioner would have to reason \"A, B, C, D,\nE\", the expert can go from A to E in a single step. We call\nthis intuition, and it isn't always a good thing: when asked\nto explain their reasoning, experts often can't, because they didn't\nactually reason their way to the solution–they just recognized it.\n\nExperts are frequently so familiar with their subject that they can\nno longer imagine what it's like to not see the world that\nway. As a result, they are often less good at teaching the subject\nthan people with less expertise who still remember what it's like\nto have to learn the things. This phenomenon is called expert\nblind spot, and\nwhile it can be overcome with training, it's part of why there is\nno correlation between how good someone is at doing research in an\narea and how good they are at teaching it\n[Marsh2002].\n\nDensely-connected knowledge graphs are also the basis for experts'\nfluid representations, i.e.,\ntheir ability to switch back and forth between different views of\na problem [Petre2016].  For example,\nwhen trying to solve a problem in mathematics, we might switch\nbetween tackling it geometrically and representing it as a set of\nequations to be solved.\n\nFinally, this metaphor also explains why experts are better at\ndiagnosis than competent practitioners: more linkages between facts\nmakes it easier to reason backward from symptoms to causes. (And\nthis in turn is why asking programmers to debug during job\ninterviews gives a more accurate impression of their ability than\nasking them to program.)\n\n\n\nThe J Word\nExperts often betray their blind spot by using the word \"just\" in\nexplanations, as in, \"Oh, it's easy, you just fire up a new virtual\nmachine and then you just install these four patches to Ubuntu and\nthen you just re-write your entire program in a pure functional\nlanguage.\" As we discuss later in Motivation, the J word\n(also sometimes called the passive dismissive adjective) should be\nbanned from classrooms, primarily because using it gives learners the\nvery clear signal that the instructor thinks their problem is trivial\nand that they therefore must be stupid.\n\nThe graph model of knowledge explains why helping learners make\nconnections is as important as introducing them to facts.  To use\nanother analogy, the more people you know in a group, the more likely\nyou are to remain part of that group.  Similarly, the more connections\na fact has to other facts, the more likely the fact is to be\nremembered.\nRepetition vs. Deliberate Practice\nThe idea that ten thousand hours of practice will make someone an\nexpert in some field is widely quoted, but reality is more complex.\nDoing exactly the same thing over and over again is much more likely\nto solidify bad habits than perfect performance.  What actually works\nis deliberate practice (also\nsometimes called reflective\npractice), which is doing similar but\nsubtly different things, paying attention to what works and what\ndoesn't, and then changing behavior in response to that feedback to\nget cumulatively better.\nA common progression is for people to go through three stages:\n\nThey learn how to do something given feedback from others.\nFor example, they might write an essay about what they did on their\nsummer holiday, and get feedback from a teacher telling them how to\nimprove it.\n\nThey learn how to give feedback.  For example, they might\nwrite an essay about character development in The Catcher in\nthe Rye, and get feedback on their critique from a teacher.\n\nThey apply what they've learned about feedback to themselves.\nAt some point, they start critiquing their own work in real time (or\nnearly so) using the critical skills they've built up in steps 1 and\n\nDoing this is so much faster than waiting for feedback from\nothers that proficiency suddenly starts to take off.\n\n\n\nA meta-study conducted in 2014\n[Macnamara2014] found that\n\"…deliberate practice explained 26% of the variance in performance for\ngames, 21% for music, 18% for sports, 4% for education, and less than\n1% for professions.\" One explanation for this variation is that\ndeliberate practice works best when the rules for evaluating success\nare very stable, but is less effective when there are more factors at\nplay (i.e., when it's harder to connect cause to effect).\nConcept Maps\nOur tool of choice to represent a knowledge graph (expert or\notherwise) is a concept map(gloss.md#concept-map).  A concept map\nis simply a picture of someone's mental model of a domain: facts are\nbubbles, and connections are labelled arcs. It is important that they\nare labelled: saying \"X and Y are related\" is only helpful if we\nexplain what the relationship is. And yes, one person's fact may be\nanother person's connection, but one of the benefits of concept\nmapping is that it makes those differences explicit.\n\nExternalizing Cognition\nConcept maps are just one way to represent our understanding of a\nsubject.  For example, Andrew Abela's decision tree\npresents a mental model of how to choose the right kind of chart for\ndifferent kinds of questions and data.  Maps, flowcharts, and\nblueprints can also be useful in some contexts.  What each does is\nexternalize cognition, i.e.,\nmake thought processes and mental models visible so that they can be\ncompared, contrasted, and combined.\n\nTo show what concept maps look like, consider this simple `for\nloop in Python:\nfor letter in \"abc\":\n      print('*' + letter)\nwhose output is:\n*a\n*b\n*c\nThe three key \"things\" in this loop are shown in the first part of the\nfigure below, but they are only half the story–and arguably, the less\nimportant half.  The second part shows the relationships between\nthose things.  We can go further and add two more relationships that\nare usually (but not always) true as shown in the third part.\n\nConcept maps can be used in many ways:\n\nConcept maps aid design of a lesson by helping authors figure out\nwhat they're trying to teach. Crucially, a concept map separates\ncontent from order: in our experience, people rarely wind up\nteaching things in the order in which they first drew them.\n\nThey also aid communication between lesson designers. Instructors\nwith very different ideas of what they're trying to teach are likely\nto pull their learners in different directions. Drawing and sharing\nconcept maps isn't guaranteed to prevent this, but it certainly\nhelps.\n\nConcept maps also aid communication with learners. While it's\npossible to give learners a pre-drawn map at the start of a lesson\nfor them to annotate, it's better to draw it piece by piece while\nteaching to reinforce the ties between what's in the map and what\nthe instructor said. (We will return to this idea when we discuss\nMayer's work on multimedia learning in Cognitive Load.\n\nConcept maps are also a useful for assessment: having learners\ndraw concept maps of what they think they just heard shows the\ninstructor what was missed and what was mis-understood.  However,\nreviewing learners' concept maps is too time-consuming for use in\nclass, but very useful in weekly lectures once learners are\nfamiliar with the technique.  The qualification is necessary\nbecause any new way of doing things initially slows people down–if\na student is trying to make sense of basic programming, asking\nthem to figure out how to draw their thoughts at the same time is\nan unfair load.  Finally, some instructors are skeptical of\nwhether novices can effectively map their understanding, since\nintrospection and explanation of understanding are generally more\nadvanced skills than understanding itself.\n\n\n\nMeetings, Meetings, Meetings\nThe next time you have a team meeting, give everyone a sheet of paper\nand have them spend a few minutes drawing a concept map of the project\nyou're all working on–separately. On the count of three, have\neveryone reveal their concept maps simultaneously. The discussion that\nfollows everyone's realization of how different their mental models of\nthe project's aims and organization are is always interesting…\n\nSeven Plus or Minus Two\nThe graph model of knowledge is wrong but useful, but another simple\nmodel has a sound physical basis.  As a rough approximation, human\nmemory can be divided into two distinct layers. The first is called\nlong-term or persistent\nmemory. It is where we store things\nlike our password, our home address, and what the clown did at our\neighth birthday party that scared us so much. It is essentially\nunbounded: barring injury or disease, we will die before it fills up.\nHowever, it is also slow to access–too slow to help us handle hungry\nlions and disgruntled family members.\nEvolution has therefore given us a second system called\nshort-term or working\nmemory. It is much faster, but also much\nsmaller: in 1956, Miller estimated that the average adult's working\nmemory could hold 7±2 items for a few seconds before things started to\ndrop out1. This is why phone numbers are typically 7 or 8 digits\nlong: back when phones had dials instead of keypads, that was the\nlongest string of numbers most adults could remember accurately for as\nlong as it took the dial to go around and around. It's also why sports\nteams tend to have about half a dozen members, or be broken down into\nsmaller groups (such as the forwards and backs in rugby).\n\nChunking\nOur minds can store larger numbers of facts in short-term memory by\ncreating chunks. For example, most of us\nwill remember a word we read as a single item, rather than as a\nsequence of letters.  Similarly, the pattern made by five spots on\ncards or dice is remembered as a whole rather than as five separate\npieces of information.  Chunks allow us to manage larger problems,\nbut can also mislead us if we mis-identify something, i.e., see it\nas something it isn't.  We will discuss this in more detail\nlater.\n\n7±2 is probably the most important number in programming. When\nsomeone is trying to write the next line of a program, or understand\nwhat's already there, she needs to keep a bunch of arbitrary facts\nstraight in her head: what does this variable represent, what value\ndoes it currently hold, etc. If the number of facts grows too large,\nher mental model of the program comes crashing down (something we have\nall experienced).\n7±2 is also the most important number in teaching. An instructor\ncannot push information directly into a learner's long-term\nmemory. Instead, whatever she presents is first represented in the\nlearner's short-term memory, and is only transferred to long-term\nmemory after it has been held there and rehearsed. If we present too\nmuch information too quickly, the new will displace the old before it\nhas a chance to consolidate in long-term memory.\nThis is why it's very important to use a technique like concept\nmapping a lesson before teaching it - an instructor needs to identify\njust how many pieces of separate information will need to be\n\"stored\" in memory as part of the lesson.\n\nBuilding Concept Maps Together\nConcept maps can be used as a classroom discussion exercise. Put\nlearners in small groups (2-4 people each), give each group some sticky\nnotes on which a few key concepts are written, and have them build a\nconcept map on a whiteboard by placing those sticky notes, connecting\nthem with labelled arcs, and adding any other concepts they think they\nneed.\n\n\n\nWhat Are We Doing Again?\nConcept maps can also be used to help build a shared understanding of\nwhat a project is trying to accomplish. Everyone independently draws a\nconcept map to show what they think the project's goals and constraints\nare. Those concept maps are then revealed simultaneously. The ensuing\ndiscussion can be…vigorous.\n\nChallenges\nConcept Mapping\nCreate a hand drawn concept map for something you would teach in five\nminutes.  (If possible, do it for the same subject that created a\nmultiple choice question for earlier.) Trade with a partner, and\ncritique each other's maps. Do they present concepts or surface\ndetail? Which of the relationships in your partner's map do you\nconsider concepts and vice versa?\n30 minutes\n\nFootnotes\n\n1. More recent estimates put the number closer to 4±1, which means that effective chunking is even more important than first thought. ↩\n\n"},"load.html":{"url":"load.html","title":"Cognitive Load","keywords":"","body":"Cognitive Load\n\nObjectives\n\nLearners can define cognitive load and explain how consideration\nof it can be used to shape instruction.\nLearners can explain what faded examples are and construct faded\nexamples for use in programming workshops.\nLearners can explain what Parson's Problems are and construct\nParson's Problems for use in programming workshops.\nLearners can describe ways in which they differ from their own\nlearners and what effect those differences have on instruction.\n\n\nIn 2006, Kirschner, Sweller, and Clark published a paper titled \"Why\nMinimal Guidance During Instruction Does Not Work: An Analysis of the\nFailure of Constructivist, Discovery, Problem-Based, Experiential, and\nInquiry-Based Teaching\"\n[Kirschner2006]. Its abstract says:\n\nAlthough unguided or minimally guided instructional approaches are\nvery popular and intuitively appealing…these approaches ignore both\nthe structures that constitute human cognitive architecture and\nevidence from empirical studies over the past half-century that\nconsistently indicate that minimally guided instruction is less\neffective and less efficient than instructional approaches that\nplace a strong emphasis on guidance of the student learning\nprocess. The advantage of guidance begins to recede only when\nlearners have sufficiently high prior knowledge to provide\n\"internal\" guidance.\n\nThe paper set off a minor academic firestorm, because beneath the\njargon the authors were claiming that inquiry-based\nlearning doesn't actually work\nvery well.  Inquiry-based learning is the practice of allowing\nlearners to ask their own questions, set their own goals, and find\ntheir own path through a subject, just as they would when solving\nproblems in real life.  It is intuitively appealing, but Kirschner\nargued that it overloads learners, since it requires them to\nsimultaneously master both a domain's factual content and its\nproblem-solving strategies.\nMore specifically, cognitive load\ntheory posits that people have to\ndeal with three things when they're learning:\n\nIntrinsic load is what people have to keep in mind in order to\ncarry out a learning task.  In a programming class, this might be\nunderstanding what a variable is, or understanding how assignment in\na programming language is different from creating a reference to a\ncell in a spreadsheet.\n\nGermane load is the (desirable) mental effort required to\ncreate linkages between new information and old (which is one of the\nthings that distinguishes learning from memorization).  An example\nmight be learning how to loop through a collection in Python.\n\nExtraneous load is everything else that distracts or gets in\nthe way, such as knowing that tabs look like multiple characters but\nonly count as one when indenting Python code.\n\n\nAccording to this theory, searching for a solution strategy is an\nextra burden on top of applying that strategy. We can therefore\naccelerate learning by giving learners worked examples that show them\na problem and a detailed step-by-step solution, followed by a series\nof faded examples. The first of these\npresents a nearly-complete use of the same problem-solving strategy\njust demonstrated, but with a small number of blanks for the learner\nto fill in. The next problem is also of the same type, but has more\nblanks, and so on until the learner is asked to solve the entire\nproblem.  (The material that isn't blank is often referred to as\nscaffolding, since it serves the same\npurpose as the scaffolding set up temporarily at a building site.)\nFor example, someone teaching Python might start by explaining this:\n# total_length([\"red\", \"green\", \"blue\"]) => 12\ndef total_length(words):\n      total = 0\n      for word in words:\n          total += len(word)\n      return total\nthen ask learners to fill in the blanks in:\n# word_lengths([\"red\", \"green\", \"blue\"]) => [3, 5, 4]\ndef word_lengths(words):\n      lengths = ____\n      for word in words:\n          lengths ____\n      return lengths\nThe next problem might be:\n# concatenate_all([\"red\", \"green\", \"blue\"]) => \"redgreenblue\"\ndef concatenate_all(words):\n      result = ____\n      for ____ in ____:\n          ____\n      return result\nand learners would finally be asked to tackle:\n# acronymize([\"red\", \"green\", \"blue\"]) => \"RGB\"\ndef acronymize(words):\n      ____\nFaded examples work because they introduce the problem-solving\nstrategy piece by piece. At each step, learners have one new problem\nto tackle.  As discussed later,\nthis is less intimidating than a blank screen or a blank sheet of\npaper.  It also encourages learners to think about the similarities\nand differences between various approaches, which helps create the\nlinkages in the mental model that instructors want them to form.\nThe key to constructing a good faded example is to think about the\nproblem-solving strategy or solution pattern that it is meant to\nteach.  For example, the series of problems are all examples of the\naccumulator pattern, in which the results of processing items\nfrom a collection are repeatedly added to a single variable in some way\nto create the final result.\nCognitive load theory has been criticized as being\nunfalsifiable: since there's no way to\ntell in advance of an experiment whether something is germane or not,\nany result can be justified after the fact by labelling things that\nhurt performance as \"extraneous\" and things that don't \"germane''.\nHowever, there is no doubt that faded examples are effective.\n\nSplit Attention\nResearch by Mayer and colleagues on the split-attention\neffect is closely related to cognitive\nload theory [Mayer2003].  Linguistic and\nvisual input are processed by different parts of the human brain,\nand linguistic and visual memories are stored separately as\nwell. This means that correlating linguistic, auditory, and visual\nstreams of information takes cognitive effort: when someone reads\nsomething while hearing it spoken aloud, their brain can't help but\ncheck that it's getting the same information on both channels.\nLearning is therefore more effective when redundant information is\nnot being presented simultaneously in two different channels. For\nexample, people find it harder to learn from a video that has both\nnarration and on-screen captions than from one that has either the\nnarration or the captions but not both.\nThis is also why it's more effective to draw a diagram piece by piece\nwhile teaching rather than presenting the whole thing at once.  If\nparts of the diagram appear at the same time as things are being said,\nthe two will be correlated in the learner's memory, so that pointing\nat part of the diagram will trigger recall of what was being said.\n\nAnother way to use cognitive load theory to construct exercises is\ncalled a Parson's Problem.  If you are\nteaching someone to speak a new language, you could ask them a\nquestion, and then give them the words they need to answer the\nquestion, but in jumbled order.  Their task is to put the words in the\nright order to answer the question grammatically, which frees them\nfrom having to think simultaneously about what to say and how to say\nit.\nSimilarly, when teaching people to program, you can give them the\nlines of code they need to solve a problem, and ask them to put them\nin the right order.  This allows them to concentrate on control flow\nand data dependencies, i.e., on what has to happen before what,\nwithout being distracted by variable naming or trying to remember what\nfunctions to call.\nPattern Recognition\nAn earlier section described how\npeople chunk related or correlated information together so that they\ncan fit more into short-term memory.  One key finding in cognition\nresearch is that experts have more and larger chunks than non-experts,\ni.e., experts \"see\" larger patterns, and have more patterns to match\nthings against.  This allows them to reason at a higher level, and\nto search for information more quickly and more accurately.\nIt is therefore tempting to try to teach patterns directly–in fact,\nsupporting this is one of the reasons programmers have been so\nenthusiastic about design patterns.  In\npractice, though, pattern catalogs are too large to flick through and\ntoo dry to memorize directly.  Giving names to a small number of\npatterns, though, does seem to help with teaching, primarily by giving\nthe learners a richer vocabulary to think and communicate with\n[Kuittinen2004].\nYou Are Not Your Learners\nPeople learn best when they care about the topic and believe they can\nmaster it. Neither fact is particularly surprising, but their\npractical implications have a lot of impact on what we teach, and the\norder in which we teach it.\nFirst, as noted in Motivation, most people don't\nactually want to program: they want to build a website or check on\nzoning regulations, and programming is just a tax they have to pay\nalong the way. They don't care how hash tables work, or even that hash\ntables exist; they just want to know how to process data faster. We\ntherefore have to make sure that everything we teach is useful right\naway, and conversely that we don't teach anything just because it's\n\"fundamental\".\nSecond, believing that something will be hard to learn is a\nself-fulfilling prophecy. This is why it's important not to say that\nsomething is easy: if someone who has been told that tries it, and it\ndoesn't work, they are more likely to become discouraged.\nIt's also why installing and configuring software is a much bigger\nproblem for us than experienced programmers like to acknowledge. It\nisn't just the time we lose at the start of boot camps as we try to\nget a Unix shell working on Windows, or set up a version control\nclient on some idiosyncratic Linux distribution.\nIt isn't even the unfairness of asking students to debug things that\ndepend on precisely the knowledge they have come to learn, but which\nthey don't yet have. The real problem is that every such failure\nreinforces the belief that computing is hard, and that they'd have a\nbetter chance of making next Thursday's deadline at work if they kept\ndoing things the way they always have. For these reasons, we have\nadopted a \"teach most immediately useful first\" approach described\nin Motivation.\nChallenges\nCreate a Faded Example\nIt's very common for programs to count how many things fall into\ndifferent categories: for example, how many times different colors\nappear in an image, or how many times different words appear in a\nparagraph of text.\n\nCreate a short example (no more than 10 lines of code) that shows\npeople how to do this, and then create a second example that solves\na similar problem in a similar way, but has a couple of blanks for\nlearners to fill in.  How did you decide what to fade out?  What\nwould the next example in the series be?\n\nDefine the audience for your examples. For example, are these\nbeginners who only know some basics programming concepts? Or are\nthese learners with some experience in programming but not in\nPython?\n\nShow your example to a partner, but do not tell them what\nlevel it is intended for.  Once they have filled in the blanks, ask\nthem what level they think it is for.\n\n\nIf there are people among the trainees who don't program at all, make\nsure that they are in separate groups and ask to the groups to work\nwith that person as a learner to help identify different loads.\n30 minutes\nCreate a Parson's Problem\nWrite five or six lines of code that does something useful, jumble\nthem, and ask your partner to put them in order.  If you are using an\nindentation-based language like Python, do not indent any of the\nlines; if you are using a curly-brace language like Java, do not\ninclude any of the curly braces.\n20 minutes\n"},"lessons.html":{"url":"lessons.html","title":"Designing Lessons","keywords":"","body":"Designing Lessons\n\nObjectives\n\nLearners can describe the steps in reverse instructional design\nand explain why it generally produces better lessons than the\nusual \"forward\" lesson development process.\nLearners can define \"teaching to the test\" and explain why\nreverse instructional design is not the same thing.\nLearners can construct and critique five-part learner profiles.\nLearners can construct good learning objectives and critique\nlearning objectives with reference to Bloom's Taxonomy.\n\n\nMost people design lessons as follows:\n\nSomeone tells you that you have to teach something you haven't\nthought about in ten years.\n\nYou start writing slides to explain what you know about the subject.\n\nAfter two or three weeks, you make up an assignment based more or\nless on what you've taught so far.\n\nYou repeat step 3 several times.\n\nYou stay awake into the wee hours of the morning to create a final\nexam.\n\n\nThere's a better way, but to explain it, we first need to explain how\ntest-driven development (TDD)\nis used in software development.  Programmers who are using TDD don't\nwrite software and then (possibly) write tests.  Instead, they write\nthe tests first, then write just enough new software to make those\ntests pass, and then clean up a bit.\nTDD works because writing tests forces programmers to specify exactly\nwhat they're trying to accomplish and what \"done\" looks like. It's\neasy to be vague when using a human language like English or Korean;\nit's much harder to be vague in Python or R.\nTDD also reduces the risk of endless polishing, and also the risk of\nconfirmation bias: someone who hasn't written a program is much more\nlikely to be objective when testing it than its original author, and\nsomeone who hasn't written a program yet is more likely to test\nit objectively than someone who has just put in several hours of hard\nwork and really, really wants to be done.\nA similar \"backward\" method works very well for lesson design.  This\nmethod is something called reverse instructional\ndesign or understanding\nby design after a book by that\nname [Wiggins2005]; a similar method is\ndescribed in [Fink2013]1.  In brief,\nlessons should be designed as follows:\n\nCreate learner profiles (discussed in the next section) to figure\nout who you are trying to teach and what will appeal to them.\n\nDraw concept maps to describe the mental model you want them to\nconstruct.\n\nCreate a summative assessment, such as a final exam or performance,\nthat will show you whether learning has actually taken place.\n\nCreate formative assessments that will give the learners a chance to\npractice the things they'll be asked to demonstrate in the summative\nassessment, and tell you and them whether they're making progress\nand where they need to focus their work.\n\nPut the formative assessments in order based on their complexity and\ndependencies.\n\nWrite just enough to get learners from one formative assessment to\nthe next.  An actual classroom lesson will typically then consist of\nthree or four such episodes, each building toward a short check that\nlearners are keeping up.\n\n\nThis method helps to keep teaching focused on its objectives. It also\nensures that learners don't face anything on the final exam that the\ncourse hasn't prepared them for.\n\nBuilding Lessons by Subtracting Complexity\nOne way to build a programming lesson is to write the program you\nwant learners to finish with, then remove the most complex part that\nyou want them to write and make it the last exercise. You can then\nremove the next most complex part you want them to write and make it\nthe penultimate exercise, and so on.  Anything that's left–i.e.,\nanything you don't want them to write as an exercise–becomes the\nstarter file(s) that you give them.  This typically includes things\nlike importing libraries or helper functions to access data.\n\n\n\nHow and Why to Fake It\nOne of the most influential papers in the history of software\nengineering was Parnas and Clements' \"A Rational Design Process: How\nand Why to Fake It\".  In it, the authors pointed out that in real\nlife we move back and forth between gathering requirements, interface\ndesign, programming, and testing, but when we write up our work it's\nimportant to describe it as if we did these steps one after another so\nthat other people can retrace our steps. The same is true of lesson\ndesign: while we may change our mind about what we want to teach based\non something that occurs to us while we're writing an MCQ, we want the\nnotes we leave behind to present things in the order described above.\n\n\n\nTeaching to the Test\nReverse instructional design is not the same thing as \"teaching to\nthe test\". When using RID, teachers set goals to aid in lesson\ndesign, and may never actually give the final exam that they\nwrote. In many school systems, on the other hand, an external\nauthority defines assessment criteria for all learners, regardless\nof their individual situations, and the outcomes of those summative\nassessments directly affect the teachers' pay and promotion.\nGreen's Building a Better Teacher\n[Green2014] argues that this focus on\nmeasurement is appealing to those with the power to set the tests,\nbut is unlikely to improve outcomes unless it is coupled with\nsupport for teachers to make improvements based on test outcomes.\nThis is often missing, because as Scott pointed out in\n[Scott1999], large organizations usually\nvalue uniformity over productivity.\n\nLearner Profiles\nThe first piece of the process above is figuring out who your audience\nis.  One way to do this is to write two or three learner\nprofiles. This technique is borrowed\nfrom user interface design, where short profiles of typical users are\ncreated to help designers think about their audience's needs, and to\ngive them a shorthand for talking about specific cases.\nLearner profiles have five parts: the person's general background,\nwhat they already know, what they think they want to do, how\nthe course will help them, and any special needs they might have. A\nlearner profile for a weekend workshop aimed at new college students\nmight be:\n\nJorge has just moved from Costa Rica to Canada to study agricultural\nengineering.  He has joined the college soccer team, and is looking\nforward to learning how to play ice hockey.\n\nOther than using Excel, Word, and the Internet, Jorge's most\nsignificant previous experience with computers is helping his sister\nbuild a WordPress site for the family business back home in Costa\nRica.\n\nJorge needs to measure properties of soil from nearby farms using a\nhandheld device that sends logs in a text format to his computer.\nRight now, Jorge has to open each file in Excel, crop the first and\nlast points, and calculate an average.\n\nThis workshop will show Jorge how to write a little Python program\nto read the data, select the right values from each file, and\ncalculate the required statistics.\n\nJorge can read English proficiently, but still struggles sometimes\nto keep up with spoken conversation (especially if it involves a lot\nof new jargon).\n\n\nA single learner profile is sometimes enough, but two or three that\ncover the whole range of potential learners is better.  One of the\nways they help is by serving as a shorthand for design issues: when\nspeaking with each other, lesson authors can say, \"Would Jorge\nunderstand why we're doing this?\" or, \"What installation problems\nwould Jorge face?\"\nLearning Objectives\nSummative and formative assessments help instructors figure out what\nthey're going to teach, but in order to communicate that to learners\nand other instructors, a course description should also have\nlearning objectives (sometimes\nalso called a learning goal). A learning objective is a single\nsentence describing what a learner will be able to do once they have\nsat through the lesson in order to demonstrate what they have learned.\nLearning objectives are meant to ensure that everyone has the same\nunderstanding of what a lesson is supposed to accomplish. For example,\na statement like \"understand Git\" could mean any of the following,\neach of this would be backed by a very different lesson:\n\nLearners can describe three scenarios in which version control\nsystems like Git are better than file-sharing tools like Dropbox,\nand two in which they are worse.\n\nLearners can commit a changed file to a Git repository using a\ndesktop GUI tool.\n\nLearners can explain what a detached HEAD is and recover from it\nusing command-line operations.\n\n\n\nObjectives vs. Outcomes\nA learning objective is what a lesson strives to achieve.  A\nlearning outcome is what it\nactually achieves, i.e., what learners actually take away.  The role\nof summative assessment is therefore to compare outcomes with\nobjectives.\n\nMore specifically, a good learning objective has a measurable or\nverifiable verb that states what the learner will do, and specifies\nthe criteria for acceptable performance.  Writing these kinds of\nlearning objectives may initially seem restrictive or limiting, but\nwill make both you, your fellow instructors, and your learners happier\nin the long run. You will end up with clear guidelines for both your\nteaching and assessment, and your learners will appreciate the clear\nexpectations.\nOne tool that can help when writing learning objectives is Bloom's\ntaxonomy, which was first published in 1956.  It\nattempts to define levels of understanding in a way that is\nhierarchical, measurable, stable, and cross-cultural.  The list below\ndefines the levels in Bloom's Taxonomy and shows some of the verbs\ntypically used in learning objectives written for each level.\n\nKnowledge: recalling learned information (name, define, recall).\n\nComprehension: explaining the meaning of information (restate, locate, explain, recognize).\n\nApplication: applying what one knows to novel, concrete situations (apply, demonstrate, use).\n\nAnalysis: breaking down a whole into its component parts and explaining how each part contributes to the whole (differentiate, criticize, compare).\n\n\nSynthesis: assembling components to form a new and integrated whole (design, construct, organize).\nEvaluation: using evidence to make judgments about the relative merits of ideas and materials (choose, rate, select).\nAnother way to understand what makes for a good learning objective\nis to see how a poor one can be improved:\n\nLearner will be given opportunities to learn good programming practices.\n\nDescribes the lesson's content, not the attributes of successful\nstudents.\n\nLearner will have a better appreciation for good programming practices.\n\nDoesn't start with an active verb or define the level of learning,\nand the subject of learning has no context and is not specific.\n\nLearner will understand how to program in R.\n\nStarts with an active verb, but doesn't define the level of\nlearning, and the subject of learning is still too vague for\nassessment.\n\nLearner will write one-page read-filter-summarize-print data\nanalysis scripts for tabular data using R and R Studio.\n\nStarts with an active verb, defines the level of learning,\nand provides context to ensure that outcomes can be assessed.\n\n\nBaume's guide to writing and using good learning outcomes\n[Baume2009] is a good longer discussion of\nthese issues.  This list of learning goals from\nthe University of British Columbia may also provide some useful\nguidance.\nChallenges\nLearner Profiles\nWorking in pairs or small groups, create a five-point profile that\ndescribes one of your typical learners.\n30 minutes\nWrite Learning Objectives\nWrite one more learning objectives for something you currently teach\nor plan to teach.

More\nimportantly, it discusses ways that we can accidentally demotivate\nthem, and how we can avoid doing that.\nPeople learn best when they care about the topic and believe they can\nmaster it. This presents us with a problem because most people don't\nactually want to program: they want to make music or compare changes\nto zoning laws with family incomes, and rightly regard programming as\na tax they have to pay in order to do so. In addition, their early\nexperiences with programming are often demoralizing, and believing\nthat something will be hard to learn is a self-fulfilling prophecy.\nImagine a grid whose axes are labelled \"mean time to master\" and\n\"usefulness once mastered\". Everything that's quick to master, and\nimmediately useful should be taught first; things in the opposite corner\nthat are hard to learn and have little near-term application don't\nbelong in this course.\n\n\nActual Time\nAny useful estimate of how long something takes to master must take\ninto account how frequent failures are and how much time is lost to\nthem. For example, editing a text file seems like a simple task, but\nmost graphical editors save things to the user's desktop or home\ndirectory.  If people need to run shell commands on the files they've\nedited, a substantial fraction won't be able to navigate to the right\ndirectory without help. If this seems like a small problem to you,\nplease revisit the discussion of expert blind spot in\nMemory.\n\nMany of the foundational concepts of computer science, such as\ncomputability, inhabit the \"useful but hard to learn\" corner of the\ngrid described above. This doesn't mean that they aren't worth\nlearning, but if our aim is to convince people that they can\nlearn this stuff, and that doing so will help them do more science\nfaster, they are less compelling than things like automating\nrepetitive tasks.\nWe therefore recommend a \"teach most immediately useful first\"\napproach.  Have learners do something that they think is useful\nin their daily work within a few minutes of starting each lesson.\nThis not only motivates them, it also helps build their confidence in\nus, so that if it takes longer to get to the payoff of a later topic,\nthey'll stick with us.\nThe best-studied use of this idea is the media computation approach\ndeveloped by Guzdial and Ericson at Georgia Tech\n[Guzdial2013].  Instead of\nprinting \"hello world\" or summing the first ten integers, their\nstudents' first program opens an image, resizes it to create a\nthumbnail, and saves the result. This is an authentic\ntask, i.e., something that learners\nbelieve they would actually do in real life. It is also has a\ntangible artifact: if the image\ncomes out the wrong size, learners have a concrete starting point for\ndebugging.\n\nStrategies for Motivating Learners\n[Ambrose2010] contains a list of\nevidence-based methods to motivate learners.  None of them are\nsurprising–it's hard to imagine someone saying that we shouldn't\nidentify and reward what we value–but it's useful to check lessons\nagainst these points to make sure they're doing at least a few of\nthese things.\nWhat's missing from this list is strategies to motivate the\ninstructor. Learners respond to an instructor's enthusiasm, and\ninstructors need to care about a topic in order to keep teaching it,\nparticularly when they are volunteers.\n\nDemotivation\n\nWomen aren't leaving computing because they don't know what it's\nlike; they're leaving because they *do know.– variously attributed\n\nIf you are teaching free-range learners, they are probably already\nmotivated–if they weren't, they wouldn't be in your classroom. The\nchallenge is therefore not to demotivate them.  Unfortunately, we can\ndo this by accident much more easily than you might think.\nThe three most powerful demotivators are unpredictability,\nindifference, and unfairness.  Unpredictability demotivates people\nbecause if there's no reliable connection between what they do and\nwhat outcome they achieve, there's no reason for them to try to do\nanything1.  If learners believe that the instructor or the\neducational system doesn't care about them or the lesson, they won't\ncare either. And if people believe the class is unfair, they will also\nbe demotivated, even if it is unfair in their favor (because\nconsciously or unconsciously they will worry that they will some day\nfind themselves in the group on the losing end\n[Wilkinson2011]).\nHere are some quick ways to demotivate your learners:\n\nA \"holier-than-thou\" or contemptuous attitude from an instructor.\n\nTell learners they are rubbish because they use Excel and/or Word,\ndon't modularize their code, etc.\n\nRepeatedly make digs about Windows and praise Linux, e.g., say that\nthe former is for amateurs.\n\nCriticize GUI applications (and by implication their users) and\ndescribe command-line tools as the One True Way.\n\nDive into complex or detailed technical discussion with the one or\ntwo people in the audience who clearly don't actually need to be\nthere.\n\nPretend to know more than you do. People will actually trust you\nmore if you are frank about the limitations of your knowledge, and\nwill be more likely to ask questions and seek help.\n\nUse the J word (\"just\"). As discussed in Memory, this\nsignals to the learner that the instructor thinks their problem is\ntrivial and by extension that they therefore must be stupid for not\nbeing able to figure it out.\n\nFeign surprise. Saying things like \"I can't believe you don't know\nX\" or \"you've never heard of Y?\" signals to the learner that they\ndo not have some required pre-knowledge of the material you are\nteaching, that they are in the wrong place, and it may prevent them\nfrom asking questions in the future. (This idea comes from the\nRecurse Center's Social Rules).\n\n\n\nCode of Conduct Revisited\nAs noted in Welcome, we believe very strongly that\nclasses should have a Code of Conduct. Its details are important, but\nthe most important thing about it is that it exists: knowing that we\nhave rules tells people a great deal about our values and about what\nkind of learning experience they can expect.\n\n\n\nNever Learn Alone\nOne way to support learners who have been subject to systematic\nexclusion or discrimination (overt or otherwise) is to have people\nsign up for workshops in small teams rather than as individuals. If\nan entire lab group comes, or if attendees are drawn from the same\n(or closely-related) disciplines, everyone in the room will know in\nadvance that they will be with at least a few people they trust,\nwhich increases the chances of them actually coming. It also helps\nafter the workshop: if people come with their friends or colleagues,\nthey can work together to implement what they've learned.\n\nImpostor Syndrome\nImpostor syndrome is the belief\nthat one is not good enough for a job or position, that one's\nachievements are lucky flukes, and an accompanying fear of being\n\"found out\". Impostor syndrome seems to be particularly common among\nhigh achievers who undertake publicly visible work.\nAcademic work is frequently undertaken alone or in small groups but\nthe results are shared and criticized publicly. In addition, we rarely\nsee the struggles of others, only their finished work, which can feed\nthe belief that everyone else finds it easy. Women and minority\ngroups who already feel additional pressure to prove themselves in\nsome settings\nmay be particularly affected.\nTwo ways of dealing with your own impostor syndrome are:\n\nAsk for feedback from someone you respect and trust. Ask them for\ntheir honest thoughts on your strengths and achievements, and commit\nto believing them.\n\nLook for role models. Who do you know who presents as confident and\ncapable? Think about how they conduct themselves. What lessons can\nyou learn from them? What habits can you borrow? (Remember, they\nquite possibly also feel as if they are making it up as they go.)\n\n\nAs an instructor, you can help people with their impostor syndrome by\nsharing stories of mistakes that you have made or things you struggled\nto learn. This reassures the class that it's OK to find topics hard.\nBeing open with the group makes it easier to build trust and make\nstudents confident to ask questions. (Live coding is great for this:\ntypos let the class see you're not superhuman.)\nYou can also emphasize that you want questions: you are not succeeding\nas a teacher if no one can follow your class, so you're asking\nstudents for their help to help you learn and improve. Remember, it's\nmuch more important to be smart than to look smart.\nThe Ada Initiative has some excellent resources for\nteaching about and dealing with imposter syndrome.\nStereotype Threat\nReminding people of negative stereotypes, even in subtle ways, makes\nthem anxious about the risk of confirming those stereotypes, which in\nturn reduces their performance. This is called stereotype\nthreat, and the clearest examples in\ncomputing are gender-related.  Depending on whose numbers you trust,\nonly 12-18% of programmers are women, and those figures have actually\nbeen getting worse over the last 20 years. There are many reasons for\nthis (see [Margolis2003] and\n[Margolis2010]), and\n[Steele2011] summarizes what we know about\nstereotype threat in general and presents some strategies for\nmitigating it in the classroom.\nHowever, while there's lots of evidence that unwelcoming climates\ndemotivate members of under-represented groups, it's not clear that\nstereotype threat is the underlying mechanism. Part of the problem is\nthat the term has been used in many\nways; another is [questions about the\nreplicability of key studies][stereotype-thread-replicability]. What\nis clear is that we need to avoid thinking in terms of a deficit\nmodel (i.e., we need to change the members of under-represented groups\nbecause they have some deficit, such as lack of prior experience) and\ninstead use a systems approach (i.e., we need to change the system\nbecause it produces these disparities).\nA great example of how stereotypes work in general was presented in\nPatitsas et al's \"Evidence That Computer Science Grades Are Not\nBimodal\" [Patitsas2016].  This\nthought-provoking paper showed that people see evidence for a \"geek\ngene\" where none exists.  As the paper's abstract says:\n\nAlthough it has never been rigorously demonstrated, there is a\ncommon belief that CS grades are bimodal. We statistically analyzed\n778 distributions of final course grades from a large research\nuniversity, and found only 5.8% of the distributions passed tests\nof multimodality. We then devised a psychology experiment to\nunderstand why CS educators believe their grades to be bimodal. We\nshowed 53 CS professors a series of histograms displaying ambiguous\ndistributions and asked them to categorize the distributions. A\nrandom half of participants were primed to think about the fact that\nCS grades are commonly thought to be bimodal; these participants\nwere more likely to label ambiguous distributions as \"bimodal\".\nParticipants were also more likely to label distributions as bimodal\nif they believed that some students are innately predisposed to do\nbetter at CS. These results suggest that bimodal grades are\ninstructional folklore in CS, caused by confirmation bias and\ninstructor beliefs about their students.\n\nIt's easy to use language that suggests that some people are natural\nprogrammers and others aren't, but Mark Guzdial has called this belief\nthe biggest myth about teaching computer science.\nMindset\nLearners can be demotivated in subtler ways as well. For example,\nDweck and others have studied the differences of fixed\nmindset and growth\nmindset. If people believe that\ncompetence in some area is intrinsic (i.e., that you either \"have the\ngene\" for it or you don't), everyone does worse, including the\nsupposedly advantaged.  The reason is that if they don't get it at\nfirst, they figure they just don't have that aptitude, which biases\nfuture performance. On the other hand, if people believe that a skill\nis learned and can be improved, they do better on average.\nA person's mindset can be shaped by subtle cues. For example, if a\nchild is told, \"You did a good job, you must be very smart,\" they are\nlikely to develop a fixed mindset. If on the other hand they are told,\n\"You did a good job, you must have worked very hard,\" they are likely\nto develop a growth mindset, and subsequently achieve more. Studies\nhave also shown that the simple action of telling learners about the\ndifferent mindsets before a course can improve learning outcomes for\nthe whole group.\nAs with stereotype threat, there are\nconcerns that research on grown mindset has\nbeen oversold, or will be much more difficult to put into practice\nthan its more enthusiastic advocates have implied.  While some people\ninterpret this back and forth of claim and counter-claim as evidence\nthan education research isn't reliable, what it really shows is that\nanything involving human subjects is both subtle and difficult.\nAccessibility\nNot providing equal access to lessons and exercises is about as\ndemotivating as it gets. If you look at the old Software Carpentry\nlessons, for example, the text beside the slides\nincludes all of the narration–but none of the Python source code.\nSomeone using a screen reader\nwould therefore be able to hear what was being said about the program,\nbut wouldn't know what the program actually was.\nWhile it may not be possible to accommodate everyone's needs, it\nis possible to get a good working structure in place without any\nspecific knowledge of what specific disabilities people might have.\nHaving at least some accommodations prepared in advance also makes it\nclear that hosts and instructors care enough to have thought about\nproblems in advance, and that any additional concerns are likely to be\naddressed.\n\nIt Helps Everyone\nCurb cuts (the small sloped ramps joining a\nsidewalk to the street) were originally created to make it easier\nfor the physically disabled to move around, but proved to be equally\nhelpful to people with strollers and grocery carts.  Similarly,\nsteps taken to make lessons more accessible to people with various\ndisabilities also help everyone else. Proper captioning of images,\nfor example, doesn't just give screen readers something to say: it\nalso makes the images more findable by exposing their content to\nsearch engines.\n\nThe first and most important step in making lessons accessible is to\ninvolve people with disabilities in decision-making: the slogan\nnihil de nobis, sine nobis (literally, \"nothing\nabout us, without us\") predates accessibility rights, but is always\nthe right place to start.  A few other recommendations are:\n\nFind out what you need to do. The W3C Accessibility Initiative's\nchecklist for presentations is a good starting\npoint focused primarily on assisting the visually impaired, while\nLiz Henry's blog post about [accessibility at\nconferences][henry-accessibility] has a good checklist for people\nwith mobility issues, and this interview with\nChad Taylor is a good introduction to issues faced by the hearing\nimpaired.\n\nKnow how well you're doing. For example, sites like\nWebAIM allow you to check how accessible your online\nmaterials are to visually impaired users.\n\nDon't do everything at once. We don't ask learners in our\nworkshops to adopt all our best practices or tools in one go, but\ninstead to work things in gradually at whatever rate they can\nmanage.  Similarly, try to build in accessibility habits when\npreparing for workshops by adding something new each time.\n\nDo the easy things first. There are plenty of ways to make\nworkshops more accessible that are both easy and don't create extra\ncognitive load for anyone: font choices, general text size, checking\nin advance that your room is accessible via an elevator or ramp,\netc.\n\n\nInclusivity\nInclusivity is a policy of including\npeople who might otherwise be excluded or marginalized. In computing,\nit means making a positive effort to be more welcoming to women,\npeople of color, people with various sexual orientations, the elderly,\nthe physically challenged, the formerly incarcerated, the economically\ndisadvantaged, and everyone else who doesn't fit Silicon Valley's\nwhite/Asian male demographic. Lee's paper \"What can I do today to\ncreate a more inclusive community in CS?\"\n[Lee2017] is a brief,\npractical guide to doing that with references to the research\nliterature. These help learners who belong to one or more marginalized\nor excluded groups, but help motivate everyone else as well; while\nthey are phrased in terms of term-long courses, many can be applied in\nour workshops:\n\nAsk learners to email you before the workshop to explain how they\nbelieve the training could help them achieve their goals.\n\nReview notes to make sure they are free from gendered pronouns, that\nthey include culturally diverse names, etc.\n\nEmphasize that what matters is the rate at which they are learning,\nnot the advantages or disadvantages they had when they started.\n\nEncourage pair programming.\n\nActively mitigate behavior that some learners may find intimidating,\ne.g., use of jargon or \"questions\" that are actually asked to\ndisplay knowledge.\n\n\nChallenges\nSeveral of these challenges use \"think-pair-share\".  If you have not\nalready covered this, please look at the\ndescription now.\nAuthentic Tasks\nThink about something you did this week that uses one or more of the\nskills you teach, (e.g., wrote a function, bulk downloaded data, did\nsome stats in R, forked a repo) and explain how you would use it (or a\nsimplified version of it) as an exercise or example in class.\nPair up with your neighbor and decide where this exercise fits on a\n2x2 grid of \"short/longtime to master\" and \"low/high usefulness\"?  In\nthe shared notes, write the task and where it fits on the grid. As a\ngroup, discuss how these relate back to the \"teach most immediately\nuseful first\" approach.\n15 minutes\nImplement One Strategy for Inclusivity\nPick one activity or change in practice from Lee's paper\n[Lee2017] that you would\nlike to work on.  Put a reminder in your calendar three months in the\nfuture to self-check whether you have done something about it.\n5 minutes\nBrainstorming Motivational Strategies\n\nThink back to a programming course (or any other) that you took in\nthe past, and identify one thing the instructor did that motivated\nyou, and describe what could have been done afterward to correct\nthe situation.\n\nPair up with your neighbor and discuss your stories, then add\nyour comments to the shared notes.\n\nReview the comments in the shared notes as a group. Rather than\nread them all out loud, highlight and discuss a few of the things\nthat could have been done differently. This will give everyone\nsome confidence in how to handle these situations in the future.\n\n\n20 minutes\nDemotivational Experiences\nThink back to a time when you demotivated a student (or when you were\ndemotivated as a student). Pair up with your neighbor and discuss what\nyou could have done differently in the situation, and then share the\nstory and what could have been done in the group notes.\n15 minutes\nWalk the Route\nFind the nearest public transportation drop-off point to your building\nand walk from there to your office and then to the nearest washroom,\nmaking notes about things you think would be difficult for someone with\nmobility issues. Now borrow a wheelchair and repeat the journey. How\ncomplete was your list of challenges? And did you notice that the first\nsentence in this challenge assumed you could actually walk?\n15 minutes\nWho Decides?\nIn [Littky2004], Kenneth Wesson wrote,\n\"If poor inner-city children consistently outscored children from\nwealthy suburban homes on standardized tests, is anyone naive enough\nto believe that we would still insist on using these tests as\nindicators of success?\" Read this article, and then\ndescribe an example from your own experience of \"objective\"\nassessments that reinforced the status quo.\n15 minutes\n\nFootnotes\n\n1. In extreme situations, learners may developed [learned helplessness]: when repeatedly subjected to negative feedback that they have no way to escape, they may learn not to even try to escape when they could. ↩\n\n"},"practices.html":{"url":"practices.html","title":"Teaching Practices","keywords":"","body":"Teaching Practices\n\nObjectives\n\nLearners can name, describe, and enact four teaching practices that\nare appropriate to use in programming workshops for adults, and\ngive a pedagogical justification for each.\nLearners can explain why instructors should not introduce new\npedagogical practices in a short workshop.\n\n\nJust as domain expertise is often a matter of pattern\nmatching, teaching expertise often comes\ndown to using good practices consistently.  None of the practices\ndescribed below are essential (except having a code of conduct), but\neach will improve lesson delivery.\nHave a Code of Conduct\nAn important part of making a class productive is to treat everyone\nwith respect.  We therefore strongly recommend that every group\noffering classes based on this material adopt a Code of Conduct like\nthe one in Conduct, and require people taking part in the\nclass to abide by it.\nWe believe equally strongly that your actual programming classes\nshould also have and enforce a Code of Conduct.  Programming is a\nscary topic for many novices, and workshops are meant to be a judgment\nfree space to learn and experiment. The behavior of the instructor and\nother participants may make more of an impression on a novice learner\nthan any \"technical\" topic you teach.\nIf you do this, hosts should point people at it during registration,\nand instructors should remind attendees of it at the start of the\nworkshop. The Code of Conduct doesn't just tell everyone what the\nrules are: it tells them that there are rules, and that they can\ntherefore expect a safe and welcoming learning experience.\nIf you are an instructor, and believe that someone in a workshop has\nviolated the Code of Conduct, you may warn them, ask them to\napologize, and/or expel them, depending on the severity of the\nviolation and whether or not you believe it was intentional.  Whatever\nyou do:\n\nDo it in front of witnesses.  Most people will tone down their\nlanguage and hostility in front of an audience, and having someone\nelse present ensures that later discussion doesn't degenerate into\nconflicting claims about who said what.\n\nContact the organizer or host of your class as soon as you can and\ndescribe what happened.  Remember, a Code of Conduct is\nmeaningless without a procedure for enforcing it.\n\n\nA Code of Conduct cannot stop people from being offensive, any more\nthan laws against theft stop people from stealing. What it can do is\nmake expectations and consequences clear.  In our experience, people\nrarely violate the Code of Conduct in person, though some are more\nlikely to online, where they feel less inhibited.  And remember, a\nCode of Conduct is not an infringement on free speech.  People have\na right to say what they think, but that doesn't mean they have a\nright to speak wherever and whenever they want.  If someone wishes to\nsay something disparaging about someone else, they can go and find a\nspace of their own in which to say it.\nStarting Out\nTo begin your class, the instructors should give a brief introduction\nthat will convey their capacity to teach the material,\naccessibility and approachability, desire for student success, and\nenthusiasm. Tailor your introduction to the students' skill level so\nthat you convey competence (without seeming too advanced) and\ndemonstrate that you can relate to the students. Throughout the\nworkshop, continually demonstrate that you are interested in student\nprogress and that you are enthusiastic about the topics.\nStudents should also introduce themselves (preferably verbally). At the\nvery least, everyone should add their name to the Etherpad, but its also\ngood for everyone at a given site to know who all is in the group. Note:\nthis can be done while setting up before the start of the class.\nOvernight Homework\nIn a two-day class, have learners read the operations checklists as\novernight homework and do their demotivational story just before\nlunch on day 2: it means day 2 starts with their questions\n(which wakes them up), and the demotivational story is a good\nlead-in to lunchtime discussion.\nNever a Blank Page\nProgramming workshops (and other kinds of classes) can be built around\na set of independent exercises, develop a single extended example in\nstages, or use a mixed strategy.  The main advantages of independent\nexercises are that people who fall behind can easily re-synchronize,\nand that lesson developers can add, remove, and rearrange material at\nwill.  A single extended example, on the other hand, will show\nlearners how the bits and pieces they're learning fit together: in\neducational parlance, it provides more opportunity for them to\nintegrate their knowledge.\nWhichever approach you take, learners should never start with a blank\npage (or screen), since they often find this intimidating or\nbewildering.  Modifying existing code instead of writing new code from\nscratch doesn't just give them structure: it is also more realistic.\nKeep in mind, however, that starter code may increase cognitive load,\nsince learners can be distracted by trying to understand it all before\nthey start their own work.\nTake Notes Together\nMany studies have shown that taking notes while learning improves\nretention [Aiken1975],\n[Bohay2011].  As discussed in\nMemory, this happens because taking notes forces you to\norganize and reflect on material as it's coming in, which in turn\nincreases the likelihood that you will transfer it to long-term memory\nin a usable way.\nOur experience, and some recent research findings, lead us to believe\nthat taking notes collaboratively helps learning even more\n[Orndorff2015], even though taking\nnotes on a computer is generally less effective than taking notes\nusing pen and paper [Mueller2014].\nTaking notes collaboratively:\n\nIt allows people to compare what they think they're hearing with\nwhat other people are hearing, which helps them fill in gaps and\ncorrect misconceptions right away.\n\nIt gives the more advanced learners in the class something useful to\ndo.  Rather than getting bored and checking Twitter during class,\nthey often take the lead in recording what's being said, which\nkeeps them engaged, and allows less advanced learners to focus\nmore of their attention on new material.  Keeping the more\nadvanced learners busy also helps the whole class stay engaged\nbecause boredom is infectious: if a handful of people start\nupdating their Facebook profiles, the people around them will\nstart checking out too.\n\nThe notes the learners take are usually more helpful to them than\nthose the instructor would prepare in advance, since the learners\nare more likely to write down what they actually found new, rather\nthan what the instructor predicted would be new.\n\nGlancing at the notes as they're being taken helps the instructor\ndiscover that the class didn't hear something important, or\nmisunderstood it.\n\n\nWe usually use Etherpad or Google Docs for\ncollaborative note-taking.  The former makes it easy to see who's\nwritten what, while the latter scales better and allows people to add\nimages to the notes.  Whichever is chosen, classes also use it to\nshare snippets of code and small datasets, and as a way for learners\nto show instructors their work (by copying and pasting it in).\nShared note-taking is almost always mentioned positively in\npost-workshop feedback.  However, it's also common for participants to\nreport that they find it distracting, as it's one more thing they have\nto keep an eye on.  We believe the positives outweigh the negatives,\nbut think that some careful controlled studies would tell us whether\nwe're right, and how to use it better.\nAssess Motivation and Prior Knowledge\nMost formal educational systems train people to treat all assessment\nas summative, i.e., to think of every interaction with a teacher as an\nevaluation, rather than as a chance to shape instruction.  For\nexample, we use a short pre-assessment questionnaire to profile\nlearners before workshops to help instructors tune the pace and level\nof material. We send this questionnaire out after people have\nregistered rather than making it part of the sign-up process because\nwhen we did the latter, many people concluded that since they couldn't\nanswer all the questions, they shouldn't enrol. We were therefore\nscaring off many of the people we most wanted to help.\nInstead of asking people how easily they could complete specific\ntasks, we could just ask them to rate their knowledge of various\nsubjects on a scale from 1 to 5. However, self-assessments of this\nkind are usually inaccurate because of the Dunning-Kruger\neffect: the less people know about a\nsubject, the less accurate their estimate of their knowledge is.\nThat said, there are things we can do:\n\nBefore running a workshop, communicate its level clearly to everyone\nwho's thinking of signing up by listing the topics that will be\ncovered and showing a few examples of exercises that people will\nbe asked to complete.\n\nProvide multiple exercises for each teaching episode so that more\nadvanced learners don't finish early and get bored.\n\nAsk more advanced learners to help people next to them. They'll\nlearn from answering their peers' questions (since it will force\nthem to think about things in new ways).\n\nThe helpers and the instructor who isn't teaching the particular\nepisode should keep an eye out for learners who are falling behind\nand intervene early so that they don't become frustrated and give\nup.\n\n\nThe most important thing is to accept that no class can possibly meet\neveryone's individual needs. If the instructor slows down to\naccommodate two people who are struggling, the other 38 are not being\nwell served.  Equally, if she spends a few minutes talking about an\nadvanced topic because two learners are bored, the 38 who don't\nunderstand it will feel left out. All we can do is tell our learners\nwhat we're doing and why, and hope that they'll understand.\nIt's important to design lessons with a particular audience in mind.\nIt's equally important to find out who's in each specific audience,\nsince this will influence how you introduce yourself, motivate topics,\nand pace the lessons.  Before the start of a Software Carpentry\ninstructor training class, we ask people to fill in a short\nquestionnaire like the one below.  It doesn't tell us everything we\nmight want to know, but it does give trainers a pretty clear idea of\nwho they're speaking to.\n\nHave you ever participated in a Software Carpentry workshop?\n(Check all that apply.)\n\nYes, as a learner.\nYes, as a helper.\nYes, as an organizer.\nYes, as an instructor.\nNo, but I am familiar with what is taught at a workshop.\nNo, and I am not familiar with what is taught at a workshop.\n\n\nWhich of these describes your teaching experience?  (Check all that\napply.)\n\nI have none.\nI have taught a seminar, workshop, or other short or informal course.\nI have been a graduate or undergraduate teaching assistant for a\ncollege- or university-level course.\nI have been the instructor-of-record for a college- or\nuniversity-level course.\nI have taught at the K-12 level.\n\n\nWhich of these describes your previous formal training in teaching?\n(Please choose only one.)\n\nNone\nA few hours\nA workshop\nA certification or short course\nA full degree\n\n\nHow frequently do you work with the tools that Software Carpentry\nteaches, such as R, Python, MATLAB, Perl, SQL, Git, and the Unix\nShell?\n\nEvery day\nA few times a week\nA few times a month\nA few times a year\nNever or almost never\n\n\nHow often would you expect to teach a Software Carpentry workshop\nafter this training?\n\nNot at all\nOnce a year\nSeveral times a year\n\n\nWhy do you want to take this training course?\n\n\nUse Sticky Notes as Status Flags\nGive each learner two sticky notes of different colours, e.g., red and\ngreen. These can be held up for voting, but their real use is as\nstatus flags. If someone has completed an exercise and wants it\nchecked, they put the green sticky note on their laptop; if they run\ninto a problem and need help, the put up the red one. This is better\nthan having people raise their hands because:\n\nit's more discreet (which means they're more likely to actually do\nit),\n\nthey can keep working while their flag is raised, and\n\nthe instructor can quickly see from the front of the room what state\nthe class is in.\n\n\nSometimes a red sticky involves a technical problem that takes a bit\nmore time to solve. To prevent this issue from slowing down the whole\nclass too much, you could use the occasion to take the small break you\nhad planned to take a bit later, giving the helper(s) time to fix the\nproblem.\nUse Sticky Notes to Distribute Attention\nSticky notes can also be used to ensure that the instructor's\nattention is fairly distributed.  Have each learner write their name\non a sticky note and put it on their laptop.  Each time the instructor\ncalls on them or answers one of their questions, their sticky note\ncomes down.  Once all the sticky notes are down, everyone puts theirs\nup again.\nThis technique makes it easy for the instructor to see who they\nhaven't spoken with recently, which in turn helps them avoid the\nunconscious trap of only interacting with the most extroverted of\ntheir learners.  It also shows learners that attention is being\ndistributed fairly, so that when they are called on, they won't feel\nlike they're being picked on.\nNever Touch the Learner's Keyboard\nIt's often tempting to fix things for learners, but when you do, it\ncan easily seem like magic (even if you narrate every step).  Instead,\ntalk your learners through whatever they need to do.  It will take\nlonger, but it's more likely to stick.\nMinute Cards\nWe frequently use sticky notes as minute\ncards: before each break, learners take a\nminute to write one positive thing on the green sticky note (e.g., one\nthing they've learned that they think will be useful), and one thing\nthey found too fast, too slow, confusing, or irrelevant on the red\none. They can use the red sticky note for questions that haven't yet\nbeen answered. While they are enjoying their coffee or lunch, the\ninstructors review and cluster these to find patterns. It only takes a\nfew minutes to see what learners are enjoying, what they still find\nconfusing, what problems they're having, and what questions are still\nunanswered.\nOne Up, One Down\nWe frequently ask for summary feedback at the end of each day. The\ninstructors ask the learners to alternately give one positive and one\nnegative point about the day, without repeating anything that has\nalready been said. This requirement forces people to say things they\notherwise might not: once all the \"safe\" feedback has been given,\nparticipants will start saying what they really think.\nMinute cards are anonymous; the alternating up-and-down feedback is\nnot.  Each mode has its strengths and weaknesses, and by providing\nboth, we hope to get the best of both worlds.\nPair Programming\nPair programming is a software development practice in which two\nprogrammers share one computer.  One person (called the driver) does\nthe typing, while the other (called the navigator) offers comments and\nsuggestions.  The two switch roles several times per hour.\nPair programming is a good practice in real life, and also a good way\nto teach [Hannay2009]\n[Porter2013]. Partners can not only help\neach other out during the practical, but can also clarify each other's\nmisconceptions when the solution is presented, and discuss common\nresearch interests during breaks. To facilitate this, we strongly\nprefer flat (dinner-style) seating to banked (theater-style) seating;\nthis also makes it easier for helpers to reach learners who need\nassistance.\nWhen pair programming is used it's important to put everyone in\npairs, not just the learners who are struggling, so that no one feels\nsingled out. It's also useful to have people sit in new places (and\nhence pair with different partners) after each coffee or meal break.\nIt's also important to have people switch roles within each pair three\nor four times per hour, so that the stronger personality in each pair\ndoesn't dominate the session1.\n\nSwitching Partners\nInstructors have mixed opinions on whether people should be required\nto change partners at regular intervals.  On the one hand, it gives\neveryone a chance to gain new insights and make new friends.  On the\nother, it is uncomfortable for introverts, and moving computers and\npower adapters to new desks several times a day is disruptive.\n\nHave Learners Make Predictions\nResearch has shown that people learn more from demonstrations if they\nare asked to predict what's going to happen\n[Miller2013].  Doing this fits naturally\ninto live coding: after adding or changing a few lines of a program,\nask someone what is going to happen when it's run.\nCollaborative Debugging\nIf you are live coding and your program doesn't work, explain the\nsymptoms to your learners.  The underlying cause often then becomes\nclear; if it doesn't, have them take turns suggesting things to try\nnext.  Be careful not to let one or two people dominate the\ndiscussion.\nPeer Instruction\nNo matter how good a teacher is, she can only say one thing at a time.\nHow then can she clear up many different misconceptions in a\nreasonable time?\nThe best solution developed so far is a technique called peer\ninstruction. Originally created by\nEric Mazur at Harvard, it has been studied extensively in a wide\nvariety of contexts, including programming\n[Porter2013]. Peer instruction combines\nformative assessment with student discussion and looks something like\nthis:\n\nGive a brief introduction to the topic.\n\nGive students an MCQ that probes for misconceptions (rather than\nsimple factual knowledge).\n\nHave all the students vote on their answers to the MCQ.\n\nIf the students all have the right answer, move on.\nIf they all have the same wrong answer, address that specific\nmisconception.\nIf they have a mix of right and wrong answers, give them\nseveral minutes to discuss those answers with one another in\nsmall groups (typically 2-4 students) and then reconvene and\nvote again.\n\n\n\nAs [this video][video-peer-instruction] shows, group discussion\nsignificantly improves students' understanding because it forces them\nto clarify their thinking, which can be enough to call out gaps in\nreasoning. Re-polling the class then lets the instructor know if they\ncan move on, or if further explanation is necessary. A final round of\nadditional explanation and discussion after the correct answer is\npresented gives students one more chance to solidify their\nunderstanding.\nPeer instruction is essentially a way to provide one-to-one mentorship\nin a scalable way. Despite this, we usually do not use it in either\nprogramming workshops or instructor training workshops because it\ntakes people time to adapt to a new way of learning–time that we\ntypically don't have in our compressed two-day format.\n\nTaking a Stand\nNote that it is important to have learners record their votes so\nthat they can't change their minds afterward and rationalize it by\nmaking excuses to themselves like \"I just misread the question\".\nMuch of the value of peer instruction comes from the jarring\nexperience of having their answer be wrong and having to think\nthrough the reasons why.\n\nSetting Up Your Learners\nAdult learners tell us that it is important to them to leave\nprogramming workshops with their own machine set up to do real\nwork. We therefore strongly recommend that instructors be prepared to\nteach on all three major platforms (Linux, Mac OS, and Windows), even\nthough it would be simpler to require learners to use just one.\nTo aid in this, put detailed setup instructions for all three\nplatforms on the workshop's website, and email learners a couple of\ndays before the workshop starts to remind them to do the setup.  Even\nwith this, a few people will always show up without the right\nsoftware, either because their other commitments didn't allow them to\ngo through the setup or because they ran into problems.  To detect\nthis, have everyone run some simple command as soon as they arrive and\nshow the instructors the result, and then have helpers and other\nlearners assist people who have run into trouble.\n\nCommon Denominators\nIf you have participants using several different operating systems,\navoid using features which are OS-specific, and point out any that\nyou do use.  For example, some shell commands take different\noptions on Mac OS than on Linux, while the \"minimize window\"\ncontrols and behavior on Windows are different from those on other\nplatforms.\n\n\n\nVirtual Machines\nWe have experimented with virtual machines (VMs) on learners'\ncomputers to reduce installation problems, but those introduce\nproblems of their own: older or smaller machines simply aren't fast\nenough, and learners often struggle to switch back and forth between\ntwo different sets of keyboard shortcuts for things like copying and\npasting.\nSome instructors use VPS over SSH or web browser pages instead. This\nsolve the installation issues, but makes us dependent on host\ninstitutions' WiFi (which can be of highly variable quality), and\nhas the issues mentioned above with things like keyboard shortcuts.\n\nSetting Up Tables\nYou may not have any control over the layout of the desks or tables in\nthe room in which your programming workshop takes place, but if you\ndo, we find it's best to have:\n\nall tables on the same level (rather than banked seating),\n\nfour people per table (so that each table can have two pairs if\nyou choose to use pair programming), and\n\nin-floor power outlets (so that you don't have to run power cords\nacross the floor that people can trip over).\n\n\nWhatever layout you have, try to make sure the seats have good back\nsupport, since people are going to be in them for an extended period,\nand check that every seat has an unobstructed view of the screen.\nSetting Up Your Own Environment\nSetting up your environment is just as important as setting up your\nlearners', but more involved.  As well as having all the software that\nthey need, and network access to the tool they're using to take notes,\nyou should also have a glass of water, or a cup of tea or coffee.\nThis helps keep your throat lubricated (as discussed in the next\nsection), but its real purpose is to give you an excuse to pause for a\ncouple of seconds and think when someone asks a hard question or you\nlose track of what you were going to say next.\nYou will probably also want some whiteboard pens and a few of the\nother things described in the travel kit\nchecklist.\nCough Drops\nIf you talk all day to a room full of people, your throat gets raw\nbecause you are irritating the epithelial cells in your larynx and\npharynx.  This doesn't just make you hoarse–it also makes you more\nvulnerable to infection (which is part of the reason people often come\ndown with colds after teaching).\nThe best way to protect yourself against this is to keep your throat\nlined, and the best way to do that is to use cough drops early and\noften.  The right ones will also help delay the onset of coffee\nbreath, for which your learners will probably be grateful.\nTeaching Online\nMany learners find it difficult to get to a workshop, either because\nthere isn't one locally or because it's difficult to schedule time\naround other commitments, so why don't we create video recordings of\nthe lessons and offer the workshop as a MOOC (Massive Open Online\nCourse)?\nThe first answer is that we did in 2010-11, but found the maintenance\ncosts unsustainable. Making a small change to this webpage only takes\na few minutes. but making any change to a video takes an hour or\nmore. In addition, most people are much less comfortable recording\nthemselves than contributing written material.\nThe second answer is that doing outperforms watching.  Specifically, a\nrecent paper by Koedinger et al\n[Koedinger2015] estimated \"…the\nlearning benefit from extra doing (1 SD increase) to be more than six\ntimes that of extra watching or reading.\" \"Doing\", in this case,\nrefers to completing an interactive or mimetic task with feedback,\nwhile \"benefit\" refers to both \"completion rates\" and \"overall\nperformance\".\nAnd while we do not (yet) have empirical data, we believe very\nstrongly that many novices would give up in despair if required to\ndebug setup and installation lessons on their own, but are more likely\nto get past these obstacles if someone is present to help them.\nAn intermediate approach that has proven quite successful is real-time\nremote instruction, in which the learners are co-located at one (or a\nfew) sites, with helpers present, while the instructor(s) teaching via\nonline video. This model has worked well for this instructor training\ncourse, and for a handful of regular workshops, but more work is\nneeded to figure out its pros and cons.\nThink-Pair-Share\nThink-pair-share is a lightweight technique that helps refine their\nideas and compare them with others'.  Each person starts by thinking\nindividually about a question or problem and jotting down a few notes.\nParticipants are then paired to explain their ideas to each another,\nand possibly to merge them or select the more interesting ones.\nFinally, a few pairs present their ideas to the whole group.\nThink-pair-share works because, to paraphrase Oscar Wilde's Lady\nWindermere, people often can't know what they're thinking until\nthey've heard themselves say it.  Pairing gives people new insight\ninto their own thinking, and forces them to think through and resolve\nany gaps or contradictions before exposing their ideas to a larger\ngroup.\nChallenges\nCreate a Questionnaire\nUsing the questionnaire shown earlier as a template, create\na short questionnaire you could give learners before teaching a class\nof your own.  What do you most want to know about their background?\n20 minutes\n\nFootnotes\n\n1. The Dunning-Kruger Effect can easily come into play in pair programming: whoever thinks they know the most can dominate the session regardless of how much they actually know. ↩\n\n"},"live.html":{"url":"live.html","title":"Live Coding","keywords":"","body":"Live Coding\n\nObjectives\n\nLearners can describe live coding and explain its advantages as a\nteaching practice for programming workshops.\nLearners can enact and critique live coding.\n\n\nTeaching is a performance art, just like drama, music, and athletics.\nAnd as in those fields, we have a collection of small tips and tricks\nto make teaching work better.\nThe first of our recommended teaching practices is so central that it\ndeserves a chapter of its own: live\ncoding.  When they are live coding,\ninstructors don't use slides.  Instead, they go through the lesson\nmaterial, typing in the code or instructions, with their learners\nfollowing along.  Its advantages are:\n\nWatching a program being written is more compelling than watching\nsomeone page through slides that present bits and pieces of the same\ncode.\n\nIt enables instructors to be more responsive to \"what if?\"\nquestions. Where a slide deck is like a railway track, live coding\nallows instructors to go off road and follow their learners'\ninterests.\n\nIt facilitates lateral knowledge transfer: people learn more than we\nrealized we were teaching by watching how instructors do\nthings.\n\nIt slows the instructor down: if she has to type in the program as\nshe goes along, she can only go twice as fast as her learners,\nrather than ten-fold faster as she could with slides.\n\nLearners get to see instructors' mistakes and how to diagnose\nand correct them. Novices are going to spend most of their time\ndoing this, but it's left out of most textbooks.\n\nWatching instructors make mistakes shows learners that it's all\nright to make mistakes of their.  Most people model the behavior of\ntheir teachers: if the instructor isn't embarrassed about making and\ntalking about mistakes, learners will be more comfortable doing so\ntoo.\n\n\nLive coding does have some drawbacks, but with practice, these can be\navoided or worked around:\n\nInstructors can go too slowly, either because they are not good\ntypists or by spending too much time looking at notes to try to\nremember what they meant to type.\n\nTyping in boilerplate code that is needed by the lesson, but not\ndirectly relevant to it (such as library import statements)\nincreases the extraneous cognitive load on your\nlearners.  Willingham says \"Memory is the residue of thought\"\n[Willingham2010], so if you\nspend your time typing boilerplate, that may be what learners will\ntake away.\n\n\n\nTeaching is theater not cinema.– Neal Davis\n\nLive coding is an example of the \"I/We/You\" approach to teaching\ndiscussed in Performance.  It takes a bit of practice\nfor instructors to get used to thinking aloud while coding in front of\nan audience, but most report that it is then no more difficult to do\nthan talking off a deck of slides.\n\nDouble Devices\nMany instructors now use two devices when teaching: a laptop plugged\ninto the projector for learners to see, and a tablet beside it on\nwhich they can view their notes and the shared notes that the learners\nare taking.  This seems to be more reliable than displaying one\nvirtual desktop while flipping back and forth to another.\n\nHere are some tips to make your live coding better:\n\nBe seen and heard.  If you are physically able to stand up\nfor a couple of hours, do it while you are teaching. When you sit\ndown, you are hiding yourself behind others for those sitting in the\nback rows. Make sure to notify the workshop organizers of your wish\nto stand up and ask them to arrange a high table, standing desk, or\nlectern.\nRegardless of whether you are standing or sitting, make sure to move\naround as much as reasonable. You can for example go to the screen\nto point something out, or draw something on the white/blackboard\n(see below). Moving around makes the teaching more lively, less\nmonotonous.  It draws the learners' attention away from their\nscreens, to you, which helps get the point you are making across.\nEven though you may have a good voice and know how to use it well,\nit may be a good idea to use a microphone, especially if the\nworkshop room is equipped with one. Your voice will be less tired,\nand you increase the chance of people with hearing difficulties\nbeing able to follow the workshop.\n\nTake it slow. For every command you type, every word of code you\nwrite, every menu item or website button you click, say out loud\nwhat you are doing while you do it, then point to the command and\nits output on the screen and go through it a second time. This not\nonly slows you down, it allows learners who are following along to\ncopy what you do, or to catch up, even when they are looking at\ntheir screen while doing it.  Whatever you do, don't copy and\npaste code: doing this practically guarantees that you'll race\nahead of your learners.\nIf the output of your command or code makes what you just typed\ndisappear from view, scroll back up so learners can see it again -\nthis is especially needed for the Unix shell lesson.  Other\noptions are to execute the same command a second time, or to copy\nand paste the last command(s) into the workshop's shared notes.\n\nMirror your learner's environment as much as possible.  You\nmay have set up your environment to your liking, with a very simple\nor rather fancy Unix prompt, colour schemes for your development\nenvironment, keyboard shortcuts etc. Your learners usually won't\nhave all of this. Try to create an environment that mirrors what\nyour learners have, and avoid using keyboard shortcuts. Some\ninstructors create a separate bare-bone' user (login) account on\ntheir laptop, or a separateteaching-only' account on the service\nbeing taught (e.g., Github).\n\nUse the screen wisely. You will need to enlarge your font\nconsiderably in order for people to read it from the back of the\nroom, which means you can put much less on the screen than you're\nused to1.  Maximize your window, and then ask everyone to give\nyou a thumbs-up or thumbs-down on its readability.  Use a black\nfont on a lightly-tinted background rather than a light font on a\ndark background–the light tint will glare less than a pure white\nbackground.\nWhen the bottom of the projector screen is at the same height, or\nbelow, the heads of the learners, people in the back won't be able\nto see the lower parts. Draw up the bottom of your window(s) to\ncompensate.\nPay attention to the room lighting as well: it should not be fully\ndark, and there should be no lights directly on or above the\npresenter's screen.  If needed, reposition the tables so all\nlearners can see the screen.\nIf you can get a second screen, use it: the extra screen real\nestate will allow you to display your code on one side and its\noutput or behavior on the other.  The second screen may require\nits own PC or laptop, so you may need to ask a helper to control\nit.\n\nMultiple Personalities\nIf you teach using a console window, such as a Unix shell, it's\nimportant to tell people when you run an in-console text editor\nand when you return to the console prompt.  Most novices have\nnever seen a window take on multiple personalities in this way,\nand can quickly become confused (particularly if the window is\nhosting an interactive interpreter prompt for Python or some\nother language as well as running shell commands and hosting\nan editor).\n\n\nUse illustrations.  Most lesson material comes with\nillustrations, and these may help learners to understand the stages\nof the lesson and to organize the material. What can work really\nwell is when you as instructor generate the illustrations on the\nwhite/blackboard as you progress through the material. This allows\nyou to build up diagrams, making them increasingly complex in\nparallel with the material you are teaching. It helps learners\nunderstand the material, makes for a more lively workshop (you'll\nhave to move between your laptop and the blackboard) and gathers the\nlearners' attention to you as well.\n\nAvoid distractions.  Turn off any notifications you may use\non your laptop, such as those from social media, email, etc. Seeing\nnotifications flash by on the screen distracts you as well as the\nlearners - and may even result in awkward situations when a message\npops up you'd rather not have others see.\n\nImprovise after you know the material.  The first time you\nteach a new lesson, you should stick fairly closely to the topics it\nlays out and the order they're in.  It may be tempting to deviate\nfrom the material because you would like to show a neat trick, or\ndemonstrate some alternative way of doing something. Don't do this,\nsince there is a fair chance you'll run into something unexpected\nthat you then have to explain.\nOnce you are more familiar with the material, though, you can and\nshould start improvising based on the backgrounds of your learners,\ntheir questions in class, and what you find most interesting about\nthe lesson.  This is like a musician playing a new song: the first\nfew times, you stick to the sheet music, but after you're\ncomfortable with it, you can start to put your own stamp on it.\nIf you really want to use something outside of the material, try it\nout thoroughly before the workshop: run through the lesson as you\nwould during the actual teaching and test the effect of your\nmodification.\nSome instructors use printouts of the lesson material during\nteaching.  Others use a second device (tablet or laptop) when\nteaching, on which they can view their own notes and the shared\nnotes the learners are taking. This seems to be more reliable than\ndisplaying one virtual desktop while flipping back and forth to\nanother.\n\nEmbrace mistakes.\nNo matter how well prepared you are, you will be making\nmistakes. Typo's are hard to avoid, you may overlook something from\nthe lesson instructions, etc. This is OK! It allows learners to see\ninstructors' mistakes and how to diagnose and correct them. Some\nmistakes are actually an opportunity to point something out, or\nreflect back on something covered earlier. Novices are going to\nspend most of their time making the same and other mistakes, but how\nto deal with them is left out of most textbooks.\n\nThe typos are the pedagogy.– Emily Jane McTavish\n\nNote: if you've given a lesson several times, you're unlikely to\nmake anything other than basic typing mistakes (which usually\naren't informative). It's worth remembering \"real\" mistakes and\nmaking them deliberately, but that often feels forced.  A better\napproach is to get learners to tell you what to do next in the\nhope that this will get you into the weeds.\n\nIt's OK to face the screen occasionally, particularly when you\nare walking through a section of code statement by statement or\ndrawing a diagram, but you shouldn't do this for more than a few\nseconds at a time2.  A good rule of thumb is to treat the\nscreen as one of your learners: if it would be uncomfortable to\nstare at someone for as long as you are spending looking at the\nscreen, it's time to turn around and face your audience.\n\nHave fun. Teaching is performance art and can be rather serious\nbusiness. On the one hand, don't let this scare you - it is much\neasier than performing Hamlet. You have an excellent script at\nyour disposal, after all! On the other hand, it is OK to add an\nelement of play, i.e. use humor and improvisation to liven up the\nworkshop. How much you are able and willing to do this is really a\nmatter of personality and taste - as well as experience. It\nbecomes easier when you are more familiar with the material,\nallowing you to relax more. Choose your words and actions wisely,\nthough. Remember that we want the learners to have a welcoming\nexperience and a positive learning environment - a misplaced joke\ncan ruin this in an instant. Start small, even just saying `that\nwas fun' after something worked well is a good start. Ask your\nco-instructors and helpers for feedback when you are unsure of the\neffect your behaviour has on the workshop.\n\n\nChallenges\nThe Bad and the Good\nWatch this video of live coding done poorly and\nthen this video of live coding done well as a\ngroup and then summarize your feedback on both using the usual 2×2\ngrid.  These videos assume learners know what a shell variable is,\nknow how to use the head command, and are familiar with the contents\nof the data files being filtered.\n20 minutes\nSee Then Do\nTeach 3-4 minutes of a lesson using live coding to a fellow trainee,\nthen swap and watch while that person live codes for you. Don't bother\ntrying to record the live coding sessions–we have found that it's\ndifficult to capture both the person and the screen with a handheld\ndevice–but give feedback the same way you have previously (positive\nand negative, content and presentation).  Explain in advance to your\nfellow trainee what you will be teaching and what the learners you\nteach it to are expected to be familiar with.\n\nWhat felt different about live coding (versus standing up and\nlecturing)? What was harder/easier?\n\nDid you make any mistakes? If so, how did you handle them?\n\nDid you talk and type at the same time, or alternate?\n\nHow often did you point at the screen? How often did you highlight\nwith the mouse?\n\nWhat will you try to do differently next time?\n\n\n30 minutes\n\nFootnotes\n\n1. You will often be reduced to 60-70 columns and 20-30 rows, which basically means that you're using a 21st Century supercomputer to emulate an early-1980s VT100 terminal. ↩\n\n\n2.

It touches on everything from the\nneuropsychology of perception and the mechanisms of memory to the\nsociology of school systems and the philosophical question of what we\nactually mean by \"learning\" (which turns out to be pretty complicated\nonce you start looking beyond the standardized Western\nclassroom). Within the broad scope of educational psychology, two\nspecific perspectives have primarily influenced our teaching practices\n(and by extension, this instructor training).\nThe first perspective is cognitivism,\nwhich treats learning as a problem in neuropsychology. Cognitivists\nfocus their attention on things like pattern recognition, memory\nformation, and recall. It is good at answering low-level questions,\nbut generally ignores larger issues like, \"What do we mean by\n'learning'?\" and, \"Who gets to decide?\"\nThe second perspective is situated\nlearning, which focuses on how\nlegitimate peripheral\nparticipation leads\nto people becoming members of a [community of\npractice][gloss.md#community-of-practice].  Unpacking those terms,\nthe situated learning perspective focuses on the transition from being\na newcomer to being accepted as a peer by those who already do the\nactivity in question. Situated learning is directly relevant to our\nlearners, many of whom ease into scientific computing by doing small\ntasks that experienced practitioners would regard as straightforward,\nbut who learn how to take on bigger and more novel challenges both\nfrom what they do and from the feedback (and welcome) it elicits. It\nis equally relevant to our instructors (i.e., you), who are\napproaching evidence-based teaching in the same way.\nFor example, Software Carpentry aims to serve researchers who are\nexploring data management and programming on their own (legitimate\nperipheral practice) and make them aware of other people doing that\nwork (simply by attending the workshop) and the best practices and\nideas of that community of practice, thereby giving them a way to\nbecome members of that community. Situated learning thus describes why\nwe teach, and recognizes that teaching and learning is necessarily\nrooted in a social context. We then depend on the cognitivist\nperspective to drive how we teach the specific content associated\nwith the community of practice.\n\nOther Perspectives\nThere are many other perspectives outside cognitivist theory—see\nthis site for summaries. Besides cognitivism,\nthose encountered most frequently include\nbehaviorism (which treats education as\nstimulus/response conditioning),\nconstructivism (which considers\nlearning an active process during which learners construct knowledge\nfor themselves), and connectivism\n(which emphasizes the social aspects of learning, particularly those\nmade possible by the Internet).  And yes, it would help if their\nnames were less similar…\n\nEducational psychology does not tell us how to teach on its own\nbecause it under-constrains the problem: in real life, several\ndifferent teaching methods might be consistent with what we currently\nknow about how learning works. We therefore have to try those methods\nin the class, with actual learners, in order to find out how well they\nbalance the different forces in play.\nDoing this is called instructional\ndesign.  If educational psychology is\nthe science, instructional design is the engineering.  For example,\nthere are good reasons to believe that children will learn how to read\nbest by starting with the sounds of letters and working up to words.\nHowever, there are equally good reasons to believe that children will\nlearn best if they are taught to recognize entire simple words like\n\"open\" and \"stop\", so that they can start using their knowledge\nsooner1.  The only way to tell which approach works best for most\nchildren, most of the time, is to try them both out2.\nUnsurprisingly, effective teaching depends on what the teacher knows,\nwhich can be divided into:\n\ncontent knowledge, such as the\n\"what\" of programming;\n\ngeneral pedagogical\nknowledge, i.e., an\nunderstanding of the psychology of learning; and\n\nthe pedagogical content\nknowledge (PCK) that\nconnects the two. PCK is things like what examples to use when\nteaching how parameters are passed to a function, or what\nmisconceptions about wildcard expansion are most common.  For\nexample, an instructor could write variable names and values on\npaper plates and then stack and unstack them to show how the call\nstack works.\n\n\nA great example of PCK is Gelman and Nolan's [Teaching Statistics: A\nBag of Tricks] [Gelman2002], which is full of\nPCK for teaching introductory statistics.  The CS Teaching\nTips site is gathering similar ideas for computing.\nMyths\nOne well-known scheme characterizes\nlearners as visual, auditory, or kinesthetic according to whether they\nlike to see things, hear things, or do things. This scheme is easy to\nunderstand, but as de Bruyckere and colleagues point out in Urban\nMyths About Learning and Education\n[DeBruyckere2015], it is almost\ncertainly false.  Unfortunately, that hasn't stopped a large number of\ncompanies from marketing products based on it to parents and school\nboards.\nThis is not the only myth to plague education. The learning pyramid\nthat shows we remember 10% of what we read, 20% of what we hear, and\nso on?  Myth. The idea that \"brain games\" can improve our\nintelligence, or at least slow its decline in old age? Also a myth, as\nare the claims that the Internet is making us dumber or that young\npeople read less than they used to.\nComputing education has its own myths. Mark Guzdial's \"Top 10 Myths\nAbout Teaching Computer Science\"\n[Guzdial2015a] are:\n\nThe lack of women in Computer Science is just like all the other\nSTEM fields.\n\nTo get more women in CS, we need more female CS faculty.\n\nA good CS teacher is a good lecturer.\n\nClickers and the like are an add-on for a good teacher.\n\nStudent evaluations are the best way to evaluate teaching.\n\nGood teachers personalize education for students' learning styles.\n\nHigh schools just can't teach CS well, so they shouldn't do it at all.\n\nThe real problem is to get more CS curriculum into the hands of\nteachers.\n\nAll I need to do to be a good CS teacher is model good software\ndevelopment practice, because my job is to produce excellent software\nengineers.\n\nSome people are just born to program.\n\n\nThe last of these is the most pervasive and most damaging.  As\ndiscussed in Motivation, Elizabeth Patitsas and others\nhave shown that grades in computing classes are not bimodal\n[Patitsas2016], i.e., there isn't one\ngroup that gets it and another that doesn't. Many of the participants\nin our workshops have advanced degrees in intellectually demanding\nsubjects, but have convinced themselves that they just don't have what\nit takes to be programmers. If all we do is dispel that belief, we\nwill have done them a service.\nFeedback on Live Coding Demo Videos\nThe two lists below summarize key feedback on the two videos used\nin the discussion of live coding.\nPart 1: How Not to Do It\n\nInstructor ignores a red sticky clearly visible on a learner's\nlaptop.\n\nInstructor is sitting, mostly looking at the laptop screen.\n\nInstructor is typing commands without saying them out loud.\n\nInstructor uses fancy shell prompt in the console window.\n\nInstructor uses small font in not full-screen console window with\nblack background.\n\nThe console window bottom is partially blocked by the learner's\nheads for those sitting in the back.\n\nInstructor receives a a pop-up notification in the middle of the\nsession.\n\nInstructor makes a mistake (a typo) but simply fixes it without\npointing it out, and redoes the command.\n\n\nPart 2: How to Do It Right\n\nInstructor checks if the learner with the red sticky on her laptop\nstill needs attention.\n\nInstructor is standing while instructing, making eye-contact with\nparticipants.\n\nInstructor is saying the commands out loud while typing them.\n\nInstructor moves to the screen to point out details of commands or\nresults.\n\nInstructor simply uses $ as shell prompt in the console window.\n\nInstructor uses big font in wide-screen console window with white\nbackground.\n\nThe console window bottom is above the learner's heads for those\nsitting in the back.\n\nInstructor makes mistake (a typo) and uses the occasion to\nillustrate how to interpret error-messages.\n\n\nEffecting Change\nThis guide is aimed primarily at people working outside mainstream\neducational institutions, but in order for us to reach and help as\nmany people as possible, we must eventually find ways to work with\nschools as they are.  Henderson et al's \"Facilitating Change in\nUndergraduate STEM Instructional Practices\"\n[Henderson2011] discusses ways to\nget educational institutions to actually change what they teach.  The\napproaches they identify include:\n\nDiffusion: STEM undergraduate instruction will be changed by\naltering the behavior of a large number of individual\ninstructors. The greatest influences for changing instructor\nbehavior lie in optimizing characteristics of the innovation and\nexploiting the characteristics of individuals and their networks.\n\nImplementation: STEM undergraduate instruction will be\nchanged by developing research-based instructional \"best\npractices\" and training instructors to use them. Instructors must\nuse these practices with fidelity to the established standard.\n\nScholarly Teaching: STEM undergraduate instruction will be\nchanged when more individual faculty members treat their teaching as\na scholarly activity.\n\nFaculty Learning Communities: STEM undergraduate instruction\nwill be changed by groups of instructors who support and sustain\neach other's interest, learning, and reflection on their teaching.\n\nQuality Assurance: STEM undergraduate instruction will be\nchanged by requiring institutions (colleges, schools, departments,\nand degree programs) to collect evidence demonstrating their success\nin undergraduate instruction. What gets measured is what gets\nimproved.\n\nOrganizational Development: STEM undergraduate instruction\nwill be changed by administrators with strong vision who can develop\nstructures and motivate faculty to adopt improved instructional\npractices.\n\nLearning Organizations: Innovation in higher education STEM\ninstruction will occur through informal communities of practice\nwithin formal organizations in which individuals develop new\norganizational knowledge through sharing implicit knowledge about\ntheir teaching.  Leaders cultivate conditions for both formal and\ninformal communities to form and thrive.\n\nComplexity Leadership: STEM undergraduate instruction is\ngoverned by a complex system. Innovation will occur through the\ncollective action of self-organizing groups within the system. This\ncollective action can be stimulated, but not controlled.\n\n\nEvaluating Impact\nA key part of effecting change is to convince people that what you're\ndoing is actually having a positive impact.  That turns out to be\nsurprisingly hard3 for free-range programming workshops:\n\nAsk learners if the workshop was useful. Study after study has\nshown that there is no correlation between how highly learners\nrate a course and how much they actually learn\n[Uttl2016], and most people working\nin education are now aware of that.\n\nGive them an exam at the end of the workshop.  Doing that\ndramatically changes the feel of the workshop, and how much they\nknow at the end of the day is a poor predictor of how much they\nwill remember two or three months later.\n\nGive them an exam two or three months later.  That's hard enough\nto do in a traditional battery-farmed learning environment; doing\nit with free-range learners is even harder.  In addition:\n\nThe people who didn't get anything out of the workshop are\nprobably less likely to take part in follow-up, so feedback\ngathered this way will be subject to self-selection bias.\n\nThe fact that learners remember something doesn't\nnecessarily mean it was useful (although they are more likely\nto remember things that are useful than things that aren't).\n\n\n\nSee if they keep using what they learned. This is a good way to\nevaluate employment-oriented skills, but equally useful for things\npeople have learned for fun.  The problem is how to do it: you\nprobably shouldn't put spyware on their computers, and follow-up\nsurveys suffer from the same low return rate and self-selection\nbias as exams.\n\nSee if they recommend the workshop to friends. This method often\nstrikes the best balance between informative and doable: if people\nare recommending your workshop to other people, that's a pretty\ngood sign.\n\n\nThere are many other options; the most important thing is to figure\nout early on how you're going to know whether you're teaching the\nright things the right way, and how you're going to convince potential\nbackers that you're doing so.\n\nFootnotes\n\n1. The first approach is called \"phonics\", and the second, \"whole language\".  The whole language approach may seem nonsensical, but more than a billion people have learned to read and write Chinese and similar ideogrammatic languages in exactly this way. ↩\n\n\n2. And to control other variables, because in practice, the teacher's enthusiasm for the teaching method may have more of an impact than the method itself, since children will model their teacher's excitement (or lack thereof) for a subject. ↩\n\n\n3. Well, it surprised me… ↩\n\n"},"why.html":{"url":"why.html","title":"Why I Teach","keywords":"","body":"Why I Teach\nWhen I first started volunteering at the University of Toronto, students\noccasionally asked me why. This was my answer:\n\nWhen I was your age, I thought universities existed to teach people\nhow to learn. Later, in grad school, I thought universities were about\ndoing research and creating new knowledge. Now that I'm in my forties,\nthough, I've realized that what we're really teaching you is how to\ntake over the world, because you're going to have to one day whether\nyou like it or not.\nMy parents are in their seventies. They don't run the world any more;\nit's people my age who pass laws, set interest rates, and make\nlife-and-death decisions in hospitals. As scary as it may be, we've\nbecome the grownups.\nTwenty years from now, though, we'll be heading for retirement and\nyou will be in charge, because there won't be anyone else to do it.\nThat may sound like a long time when you're nineteen, but let me tell\nyou, take three breaths and it's gone. That's why we give you problems\nwhose answers can't be cribbed from last year's notes. That's why we\nput you in situations where you have to figure out what needs to be\ndone right now, what can be left for later, and what you can simply\nignore. It's because if you don't start learning how to do these\nthings now, you won't be ready to do them when you have to.\n\nIt was stirring stuff, but it wasn't the whole story. I didn't just\nwant my students to make the world a better place so that I could\nretire in comfort. I want them to make it a better place because it's\nthe great adventure of our time. Just think: a hundred and fifty years\nago, most societies still practiced slavery. A hundred years ago, when\nmy grandmother was young, she wasn't legally a person in\nCanada.  Fifty years ago, most of the world's people suffered under\ntotalitarian rule; in the year I was born, judges could–and\ndid–order electroshock therapy to \"cure\" homosexuals. Yes, there's\nstill a lot wrong with the world, but look at how many more choices we\nhave than our grandparents did. Look at how many more things we can\nknow, and be, and enjoy. And most importantly, look at how many other\npeople can too.\nThis didn't happen by chance. It happened because millions of us made\nmillions of little decisions, the sum of which was a better world. We\ndon't think of these day-to-day decisions as political, but every time\nwe buy one brand of running shoe instead of another or shout an\nanatomical insult instead of a racial one at a cab driver, we're\nchoosing one vision of the world instead of another. We don't think\nabout this bigger picture most of the time, but the last century and a\nhalf shows that once enough people make \"doing the right thing\" a habit,\nthe big picture more or less takes care of itself.\nAt least, that's what I believed in 2004. I am less optimistic today.\nOne upside of nuclear apocalypse from a preventive point of view was\nthat the people pushing the buttons would pay the price. The bill for my\ngeneration's cowardice, lethargy, and greed, on the other hand, won't\ncome due 'til my daughter is grown, by which point there will be no easy\nsolutions (and quite possibly no solutions at all). The only things that\nwill save us then will be more science and more courage, both of which\nneed to be taught and practiced. Insisting on evidence, and then\nacting on it when the cost is immediate and the reward delayed,\nrequires as great a social change as emancipation or universal suffrage.\nIn his 1947 essay \"Why I Write\", George Orwell\nsaid:\n\nIn a peaceful age I might have written ornate or merely descriptive\nbooks, and might have remained almost unaware of my political\nloyalties. As it is I have been forced into becoming a sort of\npamphleteer… Every line of serious work that I have written since\n1936 has been written, directly or indirectly, against\ntotalitarianism… It seems to me nonsense, in a period like our own,\nto think that one can avoid writing of such subjects. Everyone writes\nof them in one guise or another. It is simply a question of which side\none takes…\n\nReplace \"writing\" with \"teaching\" and you'll have the reason I've done\nwhat I've done for the last thirteen years. The world doesn't get\nbetter on its own. It gets better because people make it better:\npenny by penny, vote by vote, and one lesson at a time.\n"}}}
