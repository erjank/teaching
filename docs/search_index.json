Short Version\nA Brief Introduction to Teaching shows readers how to build and\ndeliver high-quality learning experiences to adults.  It is based on\nSoftware Carpentry's instructor training\ncourse, and all material is available under the\nCreative Commons - Attribution license.\n\nThousands of grassroots \"learn to code\" groups have sprung up in the\npast few years.  They exist so that people don't have to figure out\nhow to program on their own, but ironically, that's exactly what most\nof their founders are doing when it comes to teaching.\nAs many have discovered, there's more to teaching than talking.  Good\nteachers break subjects up into digestible pieces, design lessons with\nverifiable goals in mind, check their students' progress at short\nintervals, and encourage collaboration and improvisation.  Like good\nprogramming practices, these don't have to be reinvented by every\nteacher: they can and should be taught and learned.  And while these\npractices won't magically make someone a great teacher, they do make\nmost people better teachers.\nThis book is a brief introduction to modern evidence-based teaching\npractices and how to use them to teach programming to free-range\nlearners.  It covers:\n\nhow people's thinking changes as they go from being novices to\ncompetent practitioners and then to being experts;\n\nhow to tell if your learners are keeping up with you, and what to\ndo or say when they're not;\n\nhow to design and improve lessons efficiently and collaboratively;\n\nhow and why live coding (i.e., writing programs step by\nstep in front of learners) is a better way to teach programming\nthan lectures or self-directed practice; and\n\nhow insights and techniques borrowed from the performing arts can\nmake you a better teacher.\n\n\nHistory\nI started teaching people how to program in the late 1980s.  At first,\nI went too fast, used too much jargon, and had little idea of how much\nmy learners actually understood.  I got better over time–at least, I\nthought I did–but still had no idea how effective I was compared to\nother teachers.\nIn 2010, I re-started a project called Software Carpentry.\nIts aim was (and is) to teach basic computing skills to researchers\nfrom a wide range of disciplines so that they could get more done in\nless time and with less pain.  In the two years that followed, I\ndiscovered resources like Mark Guzdial's blog [1]\nand the book How Learning Works [2].  These led\nme to other sources [3]\n[4] [5] that showed me what\nI could do to make my teaching better, and why I should believe it\nwould work.\nI started using these ideas in Software Carpentry in 2012,\nand the results were everything I'd hoped for.  Designing lessons with\ndifferent stage of cognitive development in mind, using live coding\ninstead of slides, and adopting lightweight realtime assessment\nmechanisms1 all made our workshops more effective.\nWhat made the biggest difference, though, was offering a short course\nto introduce people to these techniques and the ideas behind them.  I\noriginally delivered the course online over multiple weeks, but by\n2014 I was teaching it in two intensive days (just like our regular\nsoftware skills workshops).  A year later, \"I\" became \"we\" as people\nwho had taught regular workshops began training new instructors as\nwell.\nOver the last two years, I have run half-day and one-day versions of\nthat course for people who want to teach programming to children,\nrecent immigrants, women re-entering the workforce, and a wide variety\nof other groups.  Those experiences are the basis of this book.\nAcknowledgments\nI am grateful to everyone who helped shape the Software Carpentry\ninstructor training course, including Erin Becker, Karen Cranston,\nNeal Davis, Rayna Harris, Kate Hertweck, Christina Koch, Sue\nMcClatchy, Lex Nederbragt, Elizabeth Patitsas, Aleksandra Pawlik,\nAriel Rokem, Tracy Teal, Fiona Tweedie, Allegra Via, Anelda van der\nWalt, Belinda Weaver, Jason Williams, and the hundreds of people who\nhave gone through it over the years.  I am also grateful to Neil\nBrown, Warren Code, and Mark Degani for their feedback on this\nversion.  If you find it useful, I hope you will pass on whatever you\nhave learned to someone else.\nWho You Are\nLearner Profiles will explain how to\ndefine who a class is for.  Here, we present profiles of two typical\nparticipants in a workshop based on this book.\nSamira\n\nAn undergraduate student in mechanical engineering who first\nencountered the subject in an after-school club for girls and\nwould now like to pass on her love for it.\n\nHas done one programming class and one robotics class, and was a\nlab assistant for a couple of weekend introductions to engineering\nfor high school students at her university.\n\nWould like to learn techniques for explaining ideas and handling\nunexpected questions or situations.\n\nThis workshop will introduce her to some basic classroom practices\nand give her a chance to try them out in front of a supportive\naudience.\n\nFeels insecure about standing up and teaching a subject that she\nisn't an expert in (\"I'm not a professor!\").\n\n\nMoshe\n\nA professional programmer with two young children.  Their school\ndoesn't offer a programming class, so he has volunteered to put\none together.  After reading a dozen different \"programming for\nkids\" books, he feels more confused than ever.\n\nHas been programming in Visual Basic and C# for almost twenty\nyears, during which time he has frequently given presentations to\ncolleagues and management.\n\nWants to learn how to build lessons that both he and other people\ncan use and maintain.\n\nThis class will show him how to design and deliver lessons\ntailored for his students, how to tell how well those lessons are\nworking, and how to keep those lessons up to date.\n\nMoshe is partially deaf, and most of his students have hearing\ndisabilities as well.\n\n\nTeaching Practices\nThis material can be read on its own, but will be more effective when\ndelivered as an in-person class for up to two dozen people.  We\nsuggest that such workshops adopt these three teaching practices right\nfrom the start:\n\nHave a code of conduct.\n\nTake notes together.\n\nPre-assess learners' motivation and prior\nknowledge.\n\n\nDedication\nThis book is dedicated to my mother, Doris Wilson, who taught a lot of\nchildren how to read and write, and to believe in themselves.\nChallenges\nFavorite Class\nIn the online notes, write down your name, the best class you ever\ntook, and what made it so great.\n\nFootnotes\n\n1.

Our approach is based on the [Dreyfus model of\nskill acquisition][wikipedia-dreyfus], and more specifically on the\nwork of researchers like Patricia Benner, who studied how nurses\nprogress from being novices to being experts [1].\nBenner identified five stages of cognitive development that most\npeople go through in a fairly consistent way.  (We say \"most\" and\n\"fairly\" because human beings are variable, and there will always be\noutliers.  However, that shouldn't prevent us from making strong\nstatements about what's true for the majority.)\nFor our purposes, we simplify the five stages to three:\n\nA novice is someone who doesn't know what they don't know,\ni.e., they don't yet know what the key ideas in the domain are or\nhow they relate. They reason by analogy and guesswork, borrowing\nbits and pieces of their mental models of other domains which seem\nsuperficially similar. One sign that someone is a novice is that\ntheir questions aren't even wrong.\nFIXME: provide explanation of what \"not even wrong\" means or\ngive an example.\nFIXME: footnote pointing to motivation chapter about how important\nit is not to shame novices for their lack of understanding.\n\nA competent practitioner is someone who has a mental model\nthat's good enough for everyday purposes: they can do normal tasks\nwith normal effort under normal circumstances. This model does not\nhave to be completely accurate in order to be useful: for example,\nthe average driver's mental model of how a car works probably\ndoesn't include most of the complexities that a mechanical engineer\nwould be concerned with.\n\nAn expert is someone who can easily handle situations that are\nout of the ordinary, diagnose the causes of problems, and so on. We\nwill discuss expertise in more detail in Memory.\n\n\nOne example of a mental model is the ball-and-spring model of\nmolecules that most of us encountered in high school chemistry. Atoms\naren't actually balls, and their bonds aren't actually springs, but\nthe model does a good job of helping people reason about chemical\ncompounds and their reactions.  Another model of an atom has a small\ncentral ball (the nucleus) surrounded by orbiting electrons.  Again,\nthis model is wrong, but useful for many purposes.\nNovices, competent practitioners, and experts need to be taught\ndifferently.  In particular, presenting novices with a pile of facts\nearly on is counter-productive, because they don't yet have a model to\nfit those facts into.  (In fact, presenting too many facts too soon\ncan actually reinforce the incorrect mental model they've cobbled\ntogether.)\nInstead, the goal with novices is to help them construct a working\nmental model so that they have somewhere to put facts.  As an example\nof what this means in practice, Software Carpentry's lesson on the\nUnix shell introduces fifteen commands in three\nhours. Twelve minutes per command may seem glacially slow, but the\nlesson's real purpose isn't to teach those fifteen commands: it's to\nteach learners about paths, history, tab completion, wildcards, pipes\nand filters, command-line arguments, redirection, and all the other\nbig ideas that the shell depends on.  Once they understand those\nconcepts, people can quickly learn a repertoire of commands.  What's\nmore, later lessons on how to build functions in a programming\nlanguage can refer back to pipes and filters, which helps solidify\nboth ideas.\n\nDifferent Kinds of Lessons\nThe cognitive differences between novices and competent\npractitioners underpin the differences between two kinds of teaching\nmaterials. A tutorial's purpose is to help newcomers to a field\nbuild a mental model; a manual's role, on the other hand, is to help\ncompetent practitioners fill in the gaps in their\nknowledge. Tutorials frustrate competent practitioners because they\nmove too slowly and say things that are obvious (though of course\nthey are anything but to newcomers). Equally, manuals frustrate\nnovices because they use jargon and don't explain things. One of\nthe reasons Unix and C became popular is that Kernighan et al's\ntrilogy [2],\n[3],\n[4] somehow managed to be good\ntutorials and good manuals at the same time. Ray and Ray's book on\nUnix [5] and Fehily's introduction to SQL\n[6] are among the very few other books in\ncomputing that have accomplished this.\n\nOne of the challenges in building a mental model is to clear away\nthings that don't belong.  As Mark Twain said, \"It ain't what\nyou don't know that gets you into trouble. It's what you know for sure\nthat just ain't so.\"\nBroadly speaking, learners' misconceptions fall into three categories:\n\nSimple factual errors, such as believing that Vancouver is the\ncapital of British Columbia1. These are simple to correct, but\ngetting the facts right is not enough on its own.\n\nBroken models, such as believing that motion and acceleration\nmust be in the same direction. We can address these by having them\nreason through examples to see contradictions.\n\nFundamental beliefs, such as \"the world is only a few thousand\nyears old\" or \"human beings cannot be affecting the planet's\nclimate\". These usually cannot be addressed in class, since they\nare deeply connected to the learner's social identity and often\ncannot be reasoned away.\nFIXME: provide a computing-related example of a fundamental\nbelief that can't be reasoned away, such as \"WiFi gives you\ncancer\".\n\n\nTeaching is most effective when instructors have a way to identify and\nclear up learners' misconceptions while they are teaching.  The\ntechnical term for this is formative assessment, which is\nassessment that takes place during the lesson in order to form or\nshape it.  Learners don't pass or fail formative assessments; instead,\nits main purpose is to tell both the instructor and the learner how\nthe learner is doing, and what to focus on next.  For example, a music\nteacher might ask a student to play a scale very slowly in order to\nsee whether she is breathing correctly, and if she is not, what she\nshould change.\nThe counterpoint to formative assessment is summative\nassessment, which is used at the end of the lesson to tell whether\nthe desired learning took place and whether the learner is ready to\nmove on.  Learners either pass or fail a summative assessment. One\nexample is a driving exam, which reassures the rest of society that\nsomeone can safely be allowed on the road.\n\nConnecting Formative and Summative Assessment\nOne rule to use when designing lessons is that formative assessments\nshould prepare people for summative assessments: no one should ever\nencounter a question on an exam for which the teaching did not prepare\nthem.\n\nIn order to be useful during teaching, a formative assessment has to\nbe quick to administer and give an unambiguous result. The most widely\nused kind of formative assessment is probably the multiple choice\nquestion (MCQ). When designed well, these can do much more than just\ntell whether someone knows something or not. For example, suppose we\nare teaching children multi-digit addition. A well-designed MCQ would\nbe:\n\nQ: what is 27 + 15 ?\n\n42\n32\n312\n33\n\n\nThe correct answer is 42, but each of the other answers provides\nvaluable insight:\n\nIf the child answers 32, she is throwing away the carry completely.\n\nIf she answers 312, she knows that she can't just discard the\ncarried 1, but doesn't understand that it's actually a ten and needs\nto be added into the next column. In other words, she is treating\neach column of numbers as unconnected to its neighbors.\n\nIf she answers 33 then she knows she has to carry the 1, but is\ncarrying it back into the same column it came from.\n\n\nEach of these incorrect answers is a plausible distractor with\ndiagnostic power.  \"Plausible\" means that it looks like it could be\nright: instructors will often put supposedly-silly answers like \"a\nfish!\" on MCQs, but they don't provide any insight and learners\nactually don't find them funny. \"Diagnostic power\" means that each of\nthe distractors helps the instructor figure out what to explain to\nthat particular learner next.\nFIXME: add footnote saying that written funny usually just sounds\nforced (comedy is harder to write than tragedy), and that spontaneous\nfunny while teaching usually works better.  That said, spontaneous\ncan easily go wrong if you don't think through the implications:\nwhat's a joke to your circle of friends may turn out to be a serious\npolitical issue to your audience.\nInstructors should use MCQs or some other kind of formative assessment\nat least every 10-15 minutes in order to make sure that the class is\nactually learning. Since the average attention span is usually only this\nlong, formative assessments also help break up instructional time and\nre-focus attention. Formative assessments can also be used preemptively:\nif you start a class with an MCQ and everyone can answer it correctly,\nthen you can safely skip the part of the lecture in which you were going\nto explain something that your learners already know. (Doing this also\nhelps show learners that the instructor cares about how much they are\nlearning.)\n\nWhen to Proceed?\nAs the instructor, what should you do if most of the class votes for\none of the wrong answers? What if the votes are evenly spread between\noptions?  The answer is, \"It depends.\"  If the majority of the class\nvotes for a single wrong answer, you should go back and work on\ncorrecting that particular misconception. If answers are pretty evenly\nsplit between options, learners are probably guessing randomly and\nit's a good idea to go back to a point where everyone was on the same\npage.\nIf most of the class votes for the right answer, but a few vote for\nwrong ones, you have to decide whether you should spend time getting\nthe minority caught up, or whether it's more important to keep the\nmajority engaged.  This is just one example of one of the most\nimportant rules of teaching: no matter how hard you work, or what\nteaching practices you use, you won't always be able to give everyone\nthe help they need.\n\n\n\nA Note on MCQ Design\n\nA good MCQ tests for conceptual misunderstanding rather than simple\nfactual knowledge. If you are having a hard time coming up with\ndiagnostic distractors, then either you need to think more about your\nlearners' mental models, or your question simply isn't a good starting\npoint for an MCQ.\n\nWhen you are trying to come up with distractors, think about questions\nthat learners asked or problems they had the last time you taught this\nsubject. If you haven't taught it before, think about your own\nmisconceptions or ask colleagues about their experiences.\n\n\n\n\n\nConcept Inventories\nThe Force Concept Inventory\nis a set of MCQs designed to gauge understanding of\nbasic Newtonian mechanics. By interviewing a large number of\nrespondents, correlating their misconceptions with patterns of right and\nwrong answers to questions, and then improving the questions, it's\npossible to construct a very precise diagnostic tool. However, it's very\ncostly to do this, and students' ability to search for answers on the\ninternet is an ever-increasing threat to its validity.\n\n\n\nWe Know Less Than We Think\nBrown and Altadmri's \"Investigating Novice Programming Mistakes:\nEducator Beliefs vs Student Data\" [7] compared\nteachers' opinions about common programming errors with data from over\n100,000 students, and finds only weak consensus amongst teachers and\nbetween teachers and data.\n\nDesigning an MCQ with plausible distractors is useful even if it is\nnever used in class because it forces the instructor to think about\nthe learners' mental models and how they might be broken–in short,\nto put themselves into the learners' heads and see the topic from\ntheir point of view.\nTeaching Practices\nIf you haven't done so already, you should start using these three\nteaching practices in your instructor training workshop:\n\nUse sticky notes as status flags\n\nUse sticky notes to distribute attention\n\nUse sticky notes as minute cards\n\n\nChallenges\nYour Mental Models\nWhat do you do for a living? What is one mental model you use to frame\nand understand your work?\nSymptoms of Being a Novice\nWhat are the symptoms of being a novice?  I.e., what does someone do\nor say that leads you to classify them as a novice in some domain?\nModelling Novice Mental Models\nCreate a multiple choice question related to a topic you intend to teach\nand explain the diagnostic power of each its distractors (i.e., what\nmisconception each distractor is meant to identify).\nWhen you are done, give your MCQ to a partner, and have a look at\ntheirs.  Is the question ambiguous?  Are the misconceptions plausible?\nDo the distractors actually test for them?  Are any likely\nmisconceptions not tested for?\nOther Kinds of Formative Assessment\nDescribe another kind of formative assessment you have seen or used and\nexplain how it helps both the instructor and the learner figure out\nwhere they are and what they need to do next.\nIcebergs\nAn example of how solving problems can help people correct broken\nmental models, consider this problem from\n[8].  Imagine that you have\nplaced a cake of ice in a bathtub and then filled the tub to the rim\nwith water. When the ice melts, does the water level go up (so that\nthe tub overflows), go down, or stay the same?\nFIXME: figure\nThe correct answer is that it stays the same; figuring out why helps\npeople build a model of the relationship between weight, volume, and\ndensity.\nMinutes Cards\nWrite one thing you learned this morning that you found useful on your\ngreen sticky note, and one question you have about the material on the\nred. Do not put your name on the notes: this is meant to be\nanonymous feedback. Add your notes to the pile by the door as you leave\nto get coffee.\n\nFootnotes\n\n1.

From politicians\nto researchers and teachers themselves, reformers have designed\nsystems to find and promote those who can teach and eliminate those\nwho can't. But as Elizabeth Green explains in Building a Better\nTeacher [1], that assumption is wrong, which is why\neducational reforms based on it have repeatedly failed.\nThe book is written as a history of the people who have put that\npuzzle together in the US. Its core begins with a discussion of what\nJames Stigler discovered during a visit to Japan in the early 1990s:\n\nSome American teachers called their pattern \"I, We, You\": After\nchecking homework, teachers announced the day's topic, demonstrating\na new procedure (I)… Then they led the class in trying out a\nsample problem together (We)… Finally, they let students work\nthrough similar problems on their own, usually by silently making\ntheir way through a worksheet (You)…\nThe Japanese teachers, meanwhile, turned \"I, We, You\" inside\nout. You might call their version \"You, Y'all, We.\" They began not\nwith an introduction, but a single problem that students spent ten\nor twenty minutes working through alone (You)… While the\nstudents worked, the teacher wove through the students' desks,\nstudying what they came up with and taking notes to remember who had\nwhich idea. Sometimes the teacher then deployed the students to\ndiscuss the problem in small groups (Y'all). Next, the teacher\nbrought them back to the whole group, asking students to present\ntheir different ideas for how to solve the problem on the\nchalkboard… Finally, the teacher led a discussion, guiding\nstudents to a shared conclusion (We).\n\nIt's tempting but wrong to think that this particular teaching\ntechnique is some kind of secret sauce. The actual key is revealed in\nthe description of Akihiko Takahashi's work. In 1991, he visited the\nUnited States in a vain attempt to find the classrooms described a\ndecade earlier in a report by the National Council of Teachers of\nMathematics. He couldn't find them. Instead, he found that American\nteachers met once a year (if that) to exchange ideas about teaching,\ncompared to the weekly or even daily meetings he was used to. What was\nworse:\n\nThe teachers described lessons they gave and things students said,\nbut they did not see the practices. When it came to observing\nactual lessons–watching each other teach–they simply had no\nopportunity… They had, he realized, no jugyokenkyu.\nTranslated literally as \"lesson study\", jugyokenkyu is a\nbucket of practices that Japanese teachers use to hone their craft,\nfrom observing each other at work to discussing the lesson afterward\nto studying curriculum materials with colleagues. The practice is so\npervasive in Japanese schools that it is…effectively\ninvisible.\nAnd here lay the answer to [Akihiko's] puzzle. Of course the\nAmerican teachers' work fell short of the model set by their best\nthinkers… Without jugyokenkyu, his own classes would\nhave been equally drab. Without jugyokenkyu, how could you\neven teach?\n\nSo what does jugyokenkyu look like in practice?\n\nIn order to graduate, education majors not only had to watch their\nassigned master teacher work, they had to effectively replace him,\ninstalling themselves in his classroom first as observers and then,\nby the third week, as a wobbly…approximation of the teacher\nhimself.  It worked like a kind of teaching relay. Each trainee took\na subject, planning five days' worth of lessons… [and\nthen] each took a day. To pass the baton, you had to teach a day's\nlesson in every single subject: the one you planned and the four you\ndid not… and you had to do it right under your master\nteacher's nose. Afterward, everyone–the teacher, the college\nstudents, and sometimes even another outside observer–would sit\naround a formal table to talk about what they saw.\n[Trainees] stayed in…class until the students\nleft… They talked about what [the master teacher] had\ndone, but they spent more time poring over how the students had\nresponded: what they wrote in their notes; the ideas they came up\nwith, right and wrong; the architecture of the group\ndiscussion…\n…By the time he arrived in [the US], [Akihiko had]\nbecome…famous… giving public lessons that attracted\nhundreds, and, in one case, an audience of a thousand. He had a\nseemingly magical effect on children… But Akihiko knew he was\nno virtuoso. \"It is not only me,\" he always said…\n\"Many people.\" After all, it was his mentor…who had\ntaught him the new approach to teaching… And [he] had\ncrafted the approach along with the other math teachers in [his\nward] and beyond. Together, the group met regularly to discuss\ntheir plans for teaching… [At] the end of a discussion,\nthey'd invite each other to their classrooms to study the\nresults. In retrospect, this was the most important lesson: not how\nto give a lesson, but how to study teaching, using the cycle\nof jugyokenkyu to put…work under a microscope and\nimprove it.\n\nPutting work under a microscope in order to improve it is commonplace\nin sports and music.  A professional musician, for example, will\ndissect half a dozen different recordings of \"Body and Soul\" or\n\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" before performing it. They would also expect\nto get feedback from fellow musicians during practice and after\nperformances.  Many other disciplines work this way too: the Japanese\ndrew inspiration from Deming's ideas on continuous improvement in\nmanufacturing, while the adoption of code review\nover the last 15 years has done more to improve everyday programming\nthan any number of books or websites.\nBut this kind of feedback isn't part of teaching culture in the US,\nthe UK, Canada, or Australia.  There, what happens in the classroom\nstays in the classroom: teachers don't watch each other's lessons on a\nregular basis, so they can't borrow each other's good ideas. The\nresult is that every teacher has to invent teaching on their\nown. They may get lesson plans and assignments from colleagues, the\nschool board, a textbook publisher, or the Internet, but each teacher\nhas to figure out on their own how to combine that with the theory\nthey've learned in education school to deliver an actual lesson in an\nactual classroom for actual students.\nDemonstration lessons, in which one teacher is in front of a room full\nof students while other teachers observe, seem like a way to solve\nthis.  However, Fincher and her colleagues studied how teaching\npractices are actually transferred using both a detailed case\nstudy [2] and analysis of change\nstories [3].  The abstract of the latter\npaper sums up their findings:\n\nInnovative tools and teaching practices often fail to be adopted by\neducators in the field, despite evidence of their effectiveness.\nNaïve models of educational change assume this lack of adoption\narises from failure to properly disseminate promising work, but\nevidence suggests that dissemination via publication is simply not\neffective… We asked educators to describe changes they had\nmade to their teaching practice and analyzed the resulting\nstories… Of the 99 change stories analyzed, only three\ndemonstrate an active search for new practices or materials on the\npart of teachers, and published materials were consulted in just\neight of the stories. Most of the changes occurred locally, without\ninput from outside sources, or involved only personal interaction\nwith other educators.\n\nBarker et al found something similar [4]:\n\nAdoption is not a \"rational action,\" however, but an iterative\nseries of decisions made in a social context, relying on normative\ntraditions, social cueing, and emotional or intuitive\nprocesses… Faculty are not likely to use educational research\nfindings as the basis for adoption decisions. Faculty become aware\nof innovative practices either because a problem leads them to\nintentionally seek them out, or they hear about them through funded\ninitiatives, conferences and journals, or from colleagues. They\nexperiment (or not) for several reasons, depending on institutional\nexpectations and policies, perceived costs and benefits for\nthemselves and students, and the influence of role models. Faculty\ntend to trust other faculty whose work and institutional context is\nmore like their own. The choice to try out practices competes with\nthe need to \"cover\" material, as well as with classroom\nlayouts. Positive student feedback is taken as strong evidence by\nfaculty that they should continue a practice.\n\nThis phenomenon is sometimes called lateral knowledge transfer:\nsomeone sets out to teach X, but while watching them, their audience\nactually learns Y as well (or instead). For example, an instructor\nmight set out to show people how to do a particular statistical\nanalysis in R, but what her learners might take away is some new\nkeyboard shortcuts in R Studio. Live coding makes this much more\nlikely because it allows learners to see the \"how\" as well as the\n\"what\".\nFeedback\n\nAs the cartoon above suggests, sometimes it can be hard to receive\nfeedback, especially negative feedback.  The process is easier and\nmore productive when the people involved share ground rules and\nexpectations. This is especially important when they have different\nbackgrounds or cultural expectations about what's appropriate to say\nand what isn't.\nThere are several things you can do when receiving feedback to make\nit more effective:\nFIXME: re-word this sentence\n\nInitiate feedback. It's better to ask for feedback than to\nreceive it unwillingly.\n\nChoose your own questions, i.e., ask for specific\nfeedback. It's a lot harder for someone to answer, \"What do you\nthink?\" than to answer either, \"What is one thing I could have\ndone as an instructor to make this lesson more effective?\"  or \"If\nyou could pick one thing from the lesson to go over again, what\nwould it be?\"\nDirecting feedback like this is also more helpful to you.  It's\nalways better to try to fix one thing at once than to change\neverything and hope it's for the better.  Directing feedback at\nsomething you have chosen to work on helps you stay focused, which\nin turn increases the odds that you'll see progress.\n\nUse a feedback translator. Have a fellow instructor (or other\ntrusted person in the room) read over all the feedback and give an\nexecutive summary. It can be easier to hear \"It sounds like most\npeople are following, so you could speed up\" than to read several\nnotes all saying, \"this is too slow\" or \"this is boring\".\n\nMost importantly, be kind to yourself.  Many of us are very\ncritical of ourselves, so it's always helpful to jot down what we\nthought of ourselves before getting feedback from others.\nThat allows us to compare what we think of our performance with what\nothers think, which in turn allows us to scale the former more\naccurately.  For example, it's very common for people to think that\nthey're saying \"um\" and \"err\" all the time, when their audience\ndoesn't notice it.  Getting that feedback once allows instructors to\nadjust their assessment of themselves the next time they feel that\nway.\n\n\nFIXME: opening sentence about giving feedback\n\nBalance positive and negative feedback.  One method is a\n\"compliment sandwiches\" made up of one positive, one negative, and\na second positive observation.  Another (which we discuss below) is\nto ask for at least one point in each of several categories.\n\nThe technique we find most useful for giving feedback is to create\na 2x2 grid and put each piece of feedback in one of its four\nsquares.  The vertical axis divides positive from negative; the\nhorizontal divides content from presentation, i.e., what was said\nfrom how it was said.  Even this little bit of structure helps\npeople figure out what to say, and to separate those who have good\nideas that they can't communicate from those who are eloquent but\ndon't actually have anything to say.\nFIXME: make it clear that people giving feedback use this rubric\nas they are writing down feedback - it is not something that a\nfacilitator does afterward (although if feedback is being\ncollected, that's a useful step).\nFIXME: explain the difference between content and presentation\nmuch more clearly.\n\n\nFIXME: forward reference to feedback on demo video\n\nStudio Classes\nArchitecture schools often include studio classes, in which students\nsolve small design problems and get feedback from their peers right\nthen and there.  These classes are most effective when the instructor\ncritiques both the designs and the peer critiques, so that\nparticipants are learning not only how to make buildings, but how to\ngive and get feedback [5].  Master classes\nin music serve a similar purpose, and a few people have experimented\nwith using live coding at conferences or online in similar ways.\n\n\n\nTells\nEveryone has nervous habits. For example, many of us become \"Mickey\nMouse\" versions of ourselves when we're nervous, i.e., we talk more\nrapidly than usual, in a higher-pitched voice, and wave our arms\naround more than we usually would.\nGamblers call nervous habits like this \"tells\".  While these are\noften not as noticeable as you would think, it's good to identify ways\nto keep yourself from pacing, or fiddling with your jewellery, or not\nlooking at the audience.\n\nIf you are interested in knowing more about giving and getting\nfeedback, you may want to read Gormally et al's \"Feedback about\nTeaching in Higher Ed\" [6] and\ndiscuss ways you could make peer-to-peer feedback a routine part of\nyour teaching.  You may also enjoy Gawande's essay \"Personal Best\"\n[7], which looks at the value of\nhaving a coach.\nFIXME: say that you can't get rid of tells completely (and that trying\nto do so can make you obsess about them and apologize to the\naudience).  Better is to try to displace them, e.g., scrunching toes\ninside shoes.\nFIXME: comment about engineering your environment to give you props\nto work with that don't reveal nervousness, like a glass of water.\nForward ref to practices section.\nChallenges\nGiving Feedback\n\nWatch this video as a group and then give\nfeedback on it. Organize feedback along two axes: positive\nvs. negative and content vs. presentation.\n\nHave each person in the class add one point to a 2x2 grid on a\nwhiteboard (or in the shared notes) without duplicating any points\nthat are already up there.\n\n\nWhat did other people see that you missed?  What did they think that\nyou strongly agree or disagree with?\nFIXME: step 3 is to compare feedback with some provided by us.\nFeedback on Your Teaching\n\nSplit into groups of three.\n\nHave each person introduce themselves and then explain, in no more\nthan 90 seconds, the key idea or ideas from the Carpentry lesson\nepisode they chose before the start of the training course to another\nperson in the group while the third person records it (video and\naudio) using a cell phone or some other handheld device.\n\nAfter the first person finishes, rotate roles (she becomes the\nvideographer, her audience becomes the instructor, the person who was\nrecording becomes the audience) and then rotate roles again.\n\nAfter everyone in the group of three has finished teaching, watch the\nvideos as a group. Everyone gives feedback on all three videos, i.e.,\npeople give feedback on themselves as well as on others.\n\nAfter everyone has given feedback on all of the videos, return to the\nmain group and put all of the feedback into the notes.  Again, try to\ndivide positive from negative and content from presentation.  Try\nalso to identify each person's tells: what do they do that betrays\nnervousness, and how noticeable is it?\n\n\n\n1E.

Here, we will look at expertise: what it is,\nhow people acquire it, and how it can be harmful as well as helpful.\nWe will then see how concept maps can be used to figure out how to\nturn knowledge into lessons.\nTo start, what do we mean when we say someone is an expert?  The usual\nresponse is that they can solve problems much faster than people who\nare \"merely competent\", or that they can recognize and deal with the\ncases where the normal rules don't apply.  They also somehow make this\nlook effortless: in most cases, they just know what the right answer\nis.\nWhat makes someone an expert? The answer isn't that they know more\nfacts: competent practitioners can memorize a lot of trivia without\nany noticeable improvement to their performance.  Instead, imagine for\na moment that we store knowledge as a graph in which facts are nodes\nand relationships are arcs. (This is emphatically not how our\nbrains work, but it's a useful metaphor.) The key difference between\nexperts and people who are \"merely competent\" is that experts have\nmany more connections, i.e., their mental models are much more densely\nconnected.\nThis metaphor helps explain many observed aspects of expert behavior:\n\nExperts can jump directly from a problem to its solution because\nthere actually is a direct link between the two in their mind.\nWhere a competent practitioner would have to reason \"A, B, C, D,\nE\", the expert can go from A to E in a single step. We call\nthis intuition, and it isn't always a good thing: when asked\nto explain their reasoning, experts often can't, because they didn't\nactually reason their way to the solution–they just recognized it.\n\nExperts are frequently so familiar with their subject that they can\nno longer imagine what it's like to not see the world that\nway. As a result, they are often less good at teaching the subject\nthan people with less expertise who still remember what it's like to\nhave to learn the things. This phenomenon is called expert\nblind spot, and while it can be overcome with training, it's part\nof why there is no correlation between how good someone is at\ndoing research in an area and how good they are at teaching it\n[1].\n\nDensely-connected knowledge graphs are also the basis for\nexperts' fluid representations, i.e., their ability to switch\nback and forth between different views of a problem\n[2].  For example, when trying to solve a\nproblem in mathematics, we might switch between tackling it\ngeometrically and representing it as a set of equations to be\nsolved.\n\nFinally, this metaphor also explains why experts are better at\ndiagnosis than competent practitioners: more linkages between facts\nmakes it easier to reason backward from symptoms to causes. (And\nthis in turn is why asking programmers to debug during job\ninterviews gives a more accurate impression of their ability than\nasking them to program.)\n\n\n\nThe J Word\nExperts often betray their blind spot by using the word \"just\" in\nexplanations, as in, \"Oh, it's easy, you just fire up a new virtual\nmachine and then you just install these four patches to Ubuntu and\nthen you just re-write your entire program in a pure functional\nlanguage.\" As we discuss later in Motivation, the J word\n(also sometimes called the passive dismissive adjective) should be\nbanned from classrooms, primarily because using it gives learners the\nvery clear signal that the instructor thinks their problem is trivial\nand that they therefore must be stupid.\n\nThe graph model of knowledge explains why helping learners make\nconnections is as important as introducing them to facts.  To use\nanother analogy, the more people you know in a group, the more likely\nyou are to remain part of that group.  Similarly, the more connections\na fact has to other facts, the more likely the fact is to be\nremembered.\n\nRepetition vs. Deliberate Practice\nThe idea that ten thousand hours of practice will make someone an\nexpert in some field is widely quoted, but reality is more complex.\nDoing exactly the same thing over and over again is much more likely\nto solidify bad habits than perfect performance.  What actually works\nis deliberate practice (also sometimes called\nreflective practice), which is doing similar but subtly\ndifferent things, paying attention to what works and what doesn't, and\nthen changing behavior in response to that feedback to get\ncumulatively better.\nA common progression is for people to go through three stages:\n\nThey learn how to do something given feedback from others.\nFor example, they might write an essay about what they did on their\nsummer holiday, and get feedback from a teacher telling them how to\nimprove it.\n\nThey learn how to give feedback.  For example, they might\nwrite an essay about character development in The Catcher in\nthe Rye, and get feedback on their critique from a teacher.\n\nThey apply what they've learned about feedback to themselves.\nAt some point, they start critiquing their own work in real time (or\nnearly so) using the critical skills they've built up in steps 1 and\n\nDoing this is so much faster than waiting for feedback from\nothers that proficiency suddenly starts to take off.\n\n\n\nA meta-study conducted in 2014 [3] found\nthat \"…deliberate practice explained 26% of the variance in\nperformance for games, 21% for music, 18% for sports, 4% for\neducation, and less than 1% for professions.\" One explanation for\nthis variation is that deliberate practice works best when the rules\nfor evaluating success are very stable, but is less effective when\nthere are more factors at play (i.e., when it's harder to connect\ncause to effect).\n\nConcept Maps\nOur tool of choice to represent a knowledge graph (expert or\notherwise) is a concept map.  A concept map is simply a picture\nof someone's mental model of a domain: facts are bubbles, and\nconnections are labelled arcs. It is important that they are labelled:\nsaying \"X and Y are related\" is only helpful if we explain what the\nrelationship is. And yes, one person's fact may be another\nperson's connection, but one of the benefits of concept mapping is\nthat it makes those differences explicit.\n\nExternalizing Cognition\nConcept maps are just one way to represent our understanding of a\nsubject.  For example, Andrew Abela's decision tree\npresents a mental model of how to choose the right kind of chart for\ndifferent kinds of questions and data.  Maps, flowcharts, and\nblueprints can also be useful in some contexts.  What each does\nis externalize cognition, i.e., make thought processes and\nmental models visible so that they can be compared, contrasted, and\ncombined.\n\nTo show what concept maps look like, consider this simple `for\nloop in Python:\nfor letter in \"abc\":\n      print('*' + letter)\nwhose output is:\n*a\n*b\n*c\nThe three key \"things\" in this loop are shown in the first part of the\nfigure below, but they are only half the story–and arguably, the less\nimportant half.  The second part shows the relationships between\nthose things.  We can go further and add two more relationships that\nare usually (but not always) true as shown in the third part.\n\nConcept maps can be used in many ways:\n\nConcept maps aid design of a lesson by helping authors figure out\nwhat they're trying to teach. Crucially, a concept map separates\ncontent from order: in our experience, people rarely wind up\nteaching things in the order in which they first drew them.\n\nThey also aid communication between lesson designers. Instructors\nwith very different ideas of what they're trying to teach are likely\nto pull their learners in different directions. Drawing and sharing\nconcept maps isn't guaranteed to prevent this, but it certainly\nhelps.\n\nConcept maps also aid communication with learners. While it's\npossible to give learners a pre-drawn map at the start of a lesson\nfor them to annotate, it's better to draw it piece by piece while\nteaching to reinforce the ties between what's in the map and what\nthe instructor said. (We will return to this idea when we discuss\nMayer's work on multimedia learning in Cognitive Load.\n\nConcept maps are also a useful for assessment: having learners draw\nconcept maps of what they think they just heard shows the instructor\nwhat was missed and what was mis-understood.  However, reviewing\nlearners' concept maps is too time-consuming for use in class, but\nvery useful in weekly lectures once learners are familiar with\nthe technique.  The qualification is necessary because any new way\nof doing things initially slows people down–if a student is trying\nto make sense of basic economics, asking them to figure out how to\ndraw their thoughts at the same time is an unfair load.\nFIXME: Neil Brown is sceptical of whether novices can effectively\nmap their understanding, since introspection and explanation of\nunderstanding are generally more advanced skills than\nunderstanding itself.\n\n\n\nMeetings, Meetings, Meetings\nThe next time you have a team meeting, give everyone a sheet of paper\nand have them spend a few minutes drawing a concept map of the project\nyou're all working on–separately. On the count of three, have\neveryone reveal their concept maps simultaneously. The discussion that\nfollows everyone's realization of how different their mental models of\nthe project's aims and organization are is always interesting…\n\nSeven Plus or Minus Two\nThe graph model of knowledge is wrong but useful, but another simple\nmodel has a sound physical basis.  As a rough approximation, human\nmemory can be divided into two distinct layers. The first is\ncalled long-term or persistent memory. It is where we\nstore things like our password, our home address, and what the clown\ndid at our eighth birthday party that scared us so much. It is\nessentially unbounded: barring injury or disease, we will die before\nit fills up.  However, it is also slow to access–too slow to help us\nhandle hungry lions and disgruntled family members.\nEvolution has therefore given us a second system called short-term\nor working memory. It is much faster, but also much smaller: in\n1956, Miller estimated that the average adult's working memory could\nhold 7±2 items for a few seconds before things started to drop\nout1. This is why phone numbers are typically 7 or 8 digits long:\nback when phones had dials instead of keypads, that was the longest\nstring of numbers most adults could remember accurately for as long as\nit took the dial to go around and around. It's also why sports teams\ntend to have about half a dozen members, or be broken down into\nsmaller groups (such as the forwards and backs in rugby).\n\nSerial Position Effect\nWhen we memorize words in a list and are asked to immediately recall\nthem, the words first presented will have the best chance to be\ntransferred into long-term memory. On the other hand, the items that\nare presented last might still be in short-term memory. These are\nreferred to as the primacy and recency effects, respectively, and\ntogether they form the serial position effect.\n\n\n\nChunking\nOur minds can store larger numbers of facts in short-term memory by\ncreating chunks. For example, most of us will remember a word we\nread as a single item, rather than as a sequence of letters.\nSimilarly, the pattern made by five spots on cards or dice is\nremembered as a whole rather than as five separate pieces of\ninformation.  Chunks allow us to manage larger problems, but can\nalso mislead us if we mis-identify something, i.e., see it as\nsomething it isn't.\nFIXME: experts have more and larger chunks.  Refer forward to\nthe material from Neil Brown on patterns in \"Load\".\n\n7±2 is probably the most important number in programming. When\nsomeone is trying to write the next line of a program, or understand\nwhat's already there, she needs to keep a bunch of arbitrary facts\nstraight in her head: what does this variable represent, what value\ndoes it currently hold, etc. If the number of facts grows too large,\nher mental model of the program comes crashing down (something we have\nall experienced).\n7±2 is also the most important number in teaching. An instructor\ncannot push information directly into a learner's long-term\nmemory. Instead, whatever she presents is first represented in the\nlearner's short-term memory, and is only transferred to long-term\nmemory after it has been held there and rehearsed. If we present too\nmuch information too quickly, the new will displace the old before it\nhas a chance to consolidate in long-term memory.\nThis is why it's very important to use a technique like concept\nmapping a lesson before teaching it - an instructor needs to identify\njust how many pieces of separate information will need to be\n\"stored\" in memory as part of the lesson.\n\nBuilding Concept Maps Together\nConcept maps can be used as a classroom discussion exercise. Put\nlearners in small groups (2-4 people each), give each group some sticky\nnotes on which a few key concepts are written, and have them build a\nconcept map on a whiteboard by placing those sticky notes, connecting\nthem with labelled arcs, and adding any other concepts they think they\nneed.\n\n\n\nWhat Are We Doing Again?\nConcept maps can also be used to help build a shared understanding of\nwhat a project is trying to accomplish. Everyone independently draws a\nconcept map to show what they think the project's goals and constraints\nare. Those concept maps are then revealed simultaneously. The ensuing\ndiscussion can be…vigorous.\n\nChallenges\nThe Serial Position Effect\nRead the following list and try to memorize the items in it: cat,\napple, ball, tree, square, head, house, door, box, car, king, hammer,\nmilk, fish, book, tape, arrow, flower, key, shoe.\nWithout looking at the list again, write down as many words from the\nlist as you can. Compare to other members of the group. What words are\nremembered the most?\nThis website implements an interactive version of\nthis exercise.\nConcept Mapping\nCreate a hand drawn concept map for something you would teach in five\nminutes.  (If possible, do it for the same subject that created a\nmultiple choice question for earlier.) Trade with a partner, and\ncritique each other's maps. Do they present concepts or surface\ndetail? Which of the relationships in your partner's map do you\nconsider concepts and vice versa?\n\nFootnotes\n\n1. More recent estimates put the number closer to 4±1, which means ↩\n\nthat effective chunking is even more important than first thought.\n\n1Herbert W.

Its abstract\nsays:\n\nAlthough unguided or minimally guided instructional approaches are\nvery popular and intuitively appealing…these approaches ignore both\nthe structures that constitute human cognitive architecture and\nevidence from empirical studies over the past half-century that\nconsistently indicate that minimally guided instruction is less\neffective and less efficient than instructional approaches that\nplace a strong emphasis on guidance of the student learning\nprocess. The advantage of guidance begins to recede only when\nlearners have sufficiently high prior knowledge to provide\n\"internal\" guidance.\n\nThe paper set off a minor academic firestorm, because beneath the\njargon the authors were claiming that\ninquiry-based-learning–allowing learners to ask\ntheir own questions, set their own goals, and find their own path\nthrough a subject–is intuitively appealing, but doesn't actually work\nvery well. Kirschner et al argued that this was because it requires\nlearners to simultaneously master both a domain's factual content and\nits problem-solving strategies.\nMore specifically, the theory of cognitive\nload posits that people have to deal with\nthree things when they're learning:\n\nIntrinsic load is what people have to keep in mind in order to\ncarry out a learning task.  In a programming class, this might be\nunderstanding what a variable is, or understanding how assignment in\na programming language is different from creating a reference to a\ncell in a spreadsheet.\n\nGermane load is the (desirable) mental effort required to\ncreate linkages between new information and old (which is one of the\nthings that distinguishes learning from memorization).  An example\nmight be learning how to loop through a collection in Python.\n\nExtraneous load is everything else that distracts or gets in\nthe way, such as knowing that tabs look like multiple characters but\nonly count as one when indenting Python code.\n\n\nAccording to this theory, searching for a solution strategy is an\nextra burden on top of applying that strategy. We can therefore\naccelerate learning by giving learners worked examples that show them\na problem and a detailed step-by-step solution, followed by a series\nof faded examples. The first of these presents a\nnearly-complete use of the same problem-solving strategy just\ndemonstrated, but with a small number of blanks for the learner to\nfill in. The next problem is also of the same type, but has more\nblanks, and so on until the learner is asked to solve the entire\nproblem.\nFor example, someone teaching Python might start by explaining this:\n# total_length([\"red\", \"green\", \"blue\"]) => 12\ndef total_length(words):\n      total = 0\n      for word in words:\n          total += len(word)\n      return total\nthen ask learners to fill in the blanks in:\n# word_lengths([\"red\", \"green\", \"blue\"]) => [3, 5, 4]\ndef word_lengths(words):\n      lengths = ____\n      for word in words:\n          lengths ____\n      return lengths\nThe next problem might be:\n# concatenate_all([\"red\", \"green\", \"blue\"]) => \"redgreenblue\"\ndef concatenate_all(words):\n      result = ____\n      for ____ in ____:\n          ____\n      return result\nand learners would finally be asked to tackle:\n# acronymize([\"red\", \"green\", \"blue\"]) => \"RGB\"\ndef acronymize(words):\n      ____\nFaded examples work because they introduce the problem-solving\nstrategy piece by piece. At each step, learners have one new problem\nto tackle.  This is less intimidating than a blank screen or a blank\nsheet of paper.  It also encourages learners to think about the\nsimilarities and differences between various approaches, which helps\ncreate the linkages in the mental model that instructors want them to\nform.\nThe key to constructing a good faded example is to think about the\nproblem-solving strategy or solution pattern that it is meant to\nteach.  For example, the series of problems are all examples of the\naccumulator pattern, in which the results of processing items\nfrom a collection are repeatedly added to a single variable in some way\nto create the final result.\nCognitive load theory has been criticized as being\nunfalsifiable: since there's no way to\ntell in advance of an experiment whether something is germane or not,\nany result can be justified after the fact by labelling things that\nhurt performance as \"extraneous\" and things that don't \"germane''.\nHowever, there is no doubt that faded examples are effective.\n\nSplit Attention\nResearch by Mayer and colleagues on the split-attention\neffect is closely related to cognitive\nload theory [2].  Linguistic and visual\ninput are processed by different parts of the human brain, and\nlinguistic and visual memories are stored separately as well. This\nmeans that correlating linguistic, auditory, and visual streams of\ninformation takes cognitive effort: when someone reads something\nwhile hearing it spoken aloud, their brain can't help but check that\nit's getting the same information on both channels.\nLearning is therefore more effective when redundant information is\nnot being presented simultaneously in two different channels. For\nexample, people find it harder to learn from a video that has both\nnarration and on-screen captions than from one that has either the\nnarration or the captions but not both.\nThis is also why it's more effective to draw a diagram piece by piece\nwhile teaching rather than presenting the whole thing at once.  If\nparts of the diagram appear at the same time as things are being said,\nthe two will be correlated in the learner's memory, so that pointing\nat part of the diagram will trigger recall of what was being said.\n\nAnother way to use cognitive load theory to construct exercises is\ncalled a Parson's Problem.  If you are teaching someone to\nspeak a new language, you could ask them a question, and then give\nthem the words they need to answer the question, but in jumbled\norder.  Their task is to put the words in the right order to answer\nthe question grammatically, which frees them from having to think\nsimultaneously about what to say and how to say it.\nSimilarly, when teaching people to program, you can give them the\nlines of code they need to solve a problem, and ask them to put them\nin the right order.  This allows them to concentrate on control flow\nand data dependencies, i.e., on what has to happen before what,\nwithout being distracted by variable naming or trying to remember what\nfunctions to call.\nFIXME\nThis entire section comes from Neil Brown's feedback\nThe main thing I took from cognitive load, Sweller, and books like Dan\nWillingham's \"Why don't students like school\" and Kahneman's \"Thinking\nFast and Slow\": we can think via pattern recognition and by reasoning.\nThe key thing about experts is that they have a lot more patterns\nstored, and only reason at the high end, whereas novices reason at the\nlow end.\nI find this observation very helpful to explain a lot of novice/expert\ndifferences, and things like the expert blind spot.  A lot of teachers\nsay they get their students to plan algorithms on paper before taking\nto the keyboard to code.  I used to dislike this advice, because I\nmuch prefer sitting down and coding directly.  But what I came to\nrealise was that I don't need to plan the algorithm: I just recognise\nwhat is needed and start regurgitating the pattern(s), perhaps with a\nlittle reasoning to mesh a couple of patterns together.  Novices go\nabout it a totally different way.  Such a key point: novices\nqualitatively use a different process than experts.  A bit more on\nthat here:\nhttps://academiccomputing.wordpress.com/2013/07/10/programming-from-memory/\nThere was a chunk of work on this in the 1980s which you could briefly\ndiscuss here: a series of workshops called Empirical Studies of\nProgramming with researchers like Soloway had papers which tried to\ncategorise all the patterns.  I believe that theoretically this is\ncorrect, but in practice it turned into a long slog that wouldn't\nactually result in much use to anyone: the catalogue would be too\nlarge to flick through and too dry to memorise directly.  But really\nsome of the work on design patterns is exactly in this vein.  A bit\nmore on that here:\nhttps://academiccomputing.wordpress.com/2013/07/29/goals-plans-and-code/\nTo some extent you can view the challenge of teaching programming as\nthe struggle to instill as many of these patterns as possible into\nlearner's minds.  Probably with lots of exercises that particularly\ncover certain patterns.  I think to some extent we do design like this\n(practice loops a lot) but I'm not sure anyone ever thinks of it in\nthese terms.  You also have the complication that you're not\nnecessarily aiming for expert level...\nChallenges\nCreate a Faded Example\nIt's very common for programs to count how many things fall into\ndifferent categories: for example, how many times different colors\nappear in an image, or how many times different words appear in a\nparagraph of text.\n\nCreate a short example (no more than 10 lines of code) that shows\npeople how to do this, and then create a second example that solves\na similar problem in a similar way, but has a couple of blanks for\nlearners to fill in.  How did you decide what to fade out?  What\nwould the next example in the series be?\n\nDefine the audience for your examples. For example, are these\nbeginners who only know some basics programming concepts? Or are\nthese learners with some experience in programming but not in\nPython?\n\nShow your example to a partner, but do not tell them what\nlevel it is intended for.  Once they have filled in the blanks, ask\nthem what level they think it is for.\n\n\nIf there are people among the trainees who don't program at all, make\nsure that they are in separate groups and ask to the groups to work\nwith that person as a learner to help identify different loads.\nCreate a Parson's Problem\n\nWrite five or six lines of code that does something useful, jumble\nthem, and ask your partner to put them in order.  If you are using\nan indentation-based language like Python, do not indent any of the\nlines; if you are using a curly-brace language like Java, do not\ninclude any of the curly braces.\n\nCreate a second example similar to the first, but include one line\nof code that isn't needed to solve the problem.  How much harder is\nit for your partner to put things in order when there's unneeded\nmaterial getting in the way?\n\n\n\n1Paul Kirschner and John Sweller and Richard Clark, Why Minimal Guidance During Instruction Does Not Work: An Analysis of the Failure of Constructivist, Discovery, Problem-Based, Experiential, and Inquiry-Based Teaching, 2006.2Richard E.

Programmers who are using TDD don't write software and\nthen (possibly) write tests.  Instead, they write the tests first,\nthen write just enough new software to make those tests pass, and then\nclean up a bit.\nTDD works because writing tests forces programmers to specify exactly\nwhat they're trying to accomplish and what \"done\" looks like. It's\neasy to be vague when using a human language like English or Korean;\nit's much harder to be vague in Python or R.\nTDD also reduces the risk of endless polishing, and also the risk of\nconfirmation bias: someone who hasn't written a program is much more\nlikely to be objective when testing it than its original author, and\nsomeone who hasn't written a program yet is more likely to test\nit objectively than someone who has just put in several hours of hard\nwork and really, really wants to be done.\nA similar \"backward\" method works very well for lesson design.  This\nmethod is something called reverse instructional design or\nunderstanding by design (after a book by Wiggins and McTighe\nwith that name [1]).  There are several\nvariations, but the one we recommend has the following steps:\n\nCreate learner profiles (discussed in the next section) to figure\nout who you are trying to teach and what will appeal to them.\n\nDraw concept maps to describe the mental model you want them to\nconstruct.\n\nCreate a summative assessment, such as a final exam or performance,\nthat will show you whether learning has actually taken place.\n\nCreate formative assessments that will give the learners a chance to\npractice the things they'll be asked to demonstrate in the summative\nassessment, and tell you and them whether they're making progress\nand where they need to focus their work.\n\nPut the formative assessments in order based on their complexity and\ndependencies.\n\nWrite just enough to get learners from one formative assessment to\nthe next.  An actual classroom lesson will typically then consist of\nthree or four such episodes, each building toward a short check that\nlearners are keeping up.\n\n\nThis method helps to keep teaching focused on its objectives. It also\nensures that learners don't face anything on the final exam that the\ncourse hasn't prepared them for.\n\nHow and Why to Fake It\nOne of the most influential papers in the history of software\nengineering was Parnas and Clements' \"A Rational Design Process: How\nand Why to Fake It\".  In it, the authors pointed out that in real\nlife we move back and forth between gathering requirements, interface\ndesign, programming, and testing, but when we write up our work it's\nimportant to describe it as if we did these steps one after another so\nthat other people can retrace our steps. The same is true of lesson\ndesign: while we may change our mind about what we want to teach based\non something that occurs to us while we're writing an MCQ, we want the\nnotes we leave behind to present things in the order described above.\n\n\n\nTeaching to the Test\nReverse instructional design is not the same thing as\n\"teaching to the test\". When using RID, teachers set goals to aid in\nlesson design, and may never actually give the final exam that they\nwrote. In many school systems, on the other hand, an external\nauthority defines assessment criteria for all learners, regardless of\ntheir individual situations, and the outcomes of those summative\nassessments directly affect the teachers' pay and promotion.\nGreen's Building a Better Teacher [2] argues that this focus on\nmeasurement is appealing to those with the power to set the tests, but\nis unlikely to improve outcomes unless it is coupled with support for\nteachers to make improvements based on test outcomes.  This is often missing, because as Scott\npointed out in [3], large organizations usually\nvalue uniformity over productivity.\n\nLearner Profiles\nThe first piece of the process above is figuring out who your audience\nis.  One way to do this is to write two or three learner\nprofiles. This technique is borrowed from user interface design,\nwhere short profiles of typical users are created to help designers\nthink about their audience's needs, and to give them a shorthand for\ntalking about specific cases.\nLearner profiles have five parts: the person's general background,\nwhat they already know, what they think they want to do, how\nthe course will help them, and any special needs they might have. A\nlearner profile for a weekend workshop aimed at new college students\nmight be:\n\nJorge has just moved from Costa Rica to Canada to study agricultural\nengineering.  He has joined the college soccer team, and is looking\nforward to learning how to play ice hockey.\n\nOther than using Excel, Word, and the Internet, Jorge's most\nsignificant previous experience with computers is helping his sister\nbuild a WordPress site for the family business back home in Costa\nRica.\n\nJorge needs to measure properties of soil from nearby farms using a\nhandheld device that sends logs in a text format to his computer.\nRight now, Jorge has to open each file in Excel, crop the first and\nlast points, and calculate an average.\n\nThis workshop will show Jorge how to write a little Python program\nto read the data, select the right values from each file, and\ncalculate the required statistics.\n\nJorge can read English proficiently, but still struggles sometimes\nto keep up with spoken conversation (especially if it involves a lot\nof new jargon).\n\n\nA single learner profile is sometimes enough, but two or three that\ncover the whole range of potential learners is better.  One of the\nways they help is by serving as a shorthand for design issues: when\nspeaking with each other, lesson authors can say, \"Would Jorge\nunderstand why we're doing this?\" or, \"What installation problems\nwould Jorge face?\"\nLearning Objectives\nSummative and formative assessments help instructors figure out what\nthey're going to teach, but in order to communicate that to learners\nand other instructors, a course description should also\nhave learning objectives. A learning objective is a single\nsentence describing what a learner will be able to do once they have\nsat through the lesson in order to demonstrate what they have learned.\nLearning objectives are meant to ensure that everyone has the same\nunderstanding of what a lesson is supposed to accomplish. For example,\na statement like \"understand Git\" could mean any of the following,\neach of this would be backed by a very different lesson:\n\nLearners can describe three scenarios in which version control\nsystems like Git are better than file-sharing tools like Dropbox,\nand two in which they are worse.\n\nLearners can commit a changed file to a Git repository using a\ndesktop GUI tool.\n\nLearners can explain what a detached HEAD is and recover from it\nusing command-line operations.\n\n\n\nObjectives vs. Outcomes\nA learning objective is what a lesson strives to achieve.  A\nlearning outcome is what it actually achieves, i.e., what\nlearners actually take away.  The role of summative assessment is\ntherefore to compare outcomes with objectives.\n\nMore specifically, a good learning objective has a measurable or\nverifiable verb that states what the learner will do, and specifies\nthe criteria for acceptable performance.  Writing these kinds\nof learning objectives may initially seem restrictive or limiting, but\nwill make both you and your learners happier in the long run. You will\nend up with clear guidelines for both your teaching and assessment,\nand your learners will appreciate the clear expectations.\nOne tool that can help when writing learning objectives is Bloom's\ntaxonomy, which was first published in 1956.  It\nattempts to define levels of understanding in a way that is\nhierarchical, measurable, stable, and cross-cultural.  The table below\ndefines the levels in Bloom's Taxonomy and shows some of the verbs\ntypically used in learning objectives written for each level.\n\n\n\nLevel\nDefinition\nVerbs\n\n\n\n\nKnowledge\nrecalling learned information\nname, define, recall\n\n\nComprehension\nexplaining the meaning of information\nrestate, locate, explain, recognize\n\n\nApplication\napplying what one knows to novel, concrete situations\napply, demonstrate, use\n\n\nAnalysis\nbreaking down a whole into its component parts and explaining how each part contributes to the whole\ndifferentiate, criticize, compare\n\n\nSynthesis\nassembling components to form a new and integrated whole\ndesign, construct, organize\n\n\nEvaluation\nusing evidence to make judgments about the relative merits of ideas and materials\nchoose, rate, select\n\n\n\nAnother way to understand what makes for a good learning objective\nis to see how a poor one can be improved:\n\n\n\nObjective\nComments\n\n\n\n\nLearner will be given opportunities to learn good programming practices.\nDescribes the lesson's content, not the attributes of successful students.\n\n\nLearner will have a better appreciation for good programming practices.\nDoesn't start with an active verb or define the level of learning, and the subject of learning has no context and is not specific.\n\n\nLearner will understand how to program in R.\nStarts with an active verb, but doesn't define the level of learning, and the subject of learning is still too vague for assessment.\n\n\nLearner will write one-page read-filter-summarize-print data analysis scripts for tabular data using R and R Studio.\nStarts with an active verb, defines the level of learning, and provides context to ensure that outcomes can be assessed.\n\n\n\nBaume's guide to writing and using good learning outcomes\n[4] is a good longer discussion of these issues.\nChallenges\nLearner Profiles\nWorking in pairs or small groups, create a five-point profile that\ndescribes one of your typical learners.\nWrite Learning Objectives\nWrite one more learning objectives for something you currently teach\nor plan to teach.  Working with a partner, critique and improve the\nobjectives.\n\n1G.P. Wiggins and J. McTighe, Understanding by Design, Association for Supervision and Curriculum Development, 2005.2E.

More\nimportantly, it discusses ways that we can accidentally demotivate\nthem, and how we can avoid doing that.\nPeople learn best when they care about the topic and believe they can\nmaster it. This presents us with a problem because most people don't\nactually want to program: they want to make music or compare changes\nto zoning laws with family incomes, and rightly regarding programming\nas a tax they have to pay in order to do so. In addition, their early\nexperiences with programming are often demoralizing, and believing\nthat something will be hard to learn is a self-fulfilling prophecy.\nImagine a grid whose axes are labelled \"mean time to master\" and\n\"usefulness once mastered\". Everything that's quick to master, and\nimmediately useful should be taught first; things in the opposite corner\nthat are hard to learn and have little near-term application don't\nbelong in this course.\n\n\nActual Time\nAny useful estimate of how long something takes to master must take\ninto account how frequent failures are and how much time is lost to\nthem. For example, editing a text file seems like a simple task, but\nmost graphical editors save things to the user's desktop or home\ndirectory.  If people need to run shell commands on the files they've\nedited, a substantial fraction won't be able to navigate to the right\ndirectory without help. If this seems like a small problem to you,\nplease revisit the discussion of expert blind spot in\nMemory.\n\nMany of the foundational concepts of computer science, such as\ncomputability, inhabit the \"useful but hard to learn\" corner of the\ngrid described above. This doesn't mean that they aren't worth\nlearning, but if our aim is to convince people that they can\nlearn this stuff, and that doing so will help them do more science\nfaster, they are less compelling than things like automating\nrepetitive tasks.\nWe therefore recommend a \"teach most immediately useful first\"\napproach.  Have learners do something that they think is useful\nin their daily work within a few minutes of starting each lesson.\nThis not only motivates them, it also helps build their confidence in\nus, so that if it takes longer to get to the payoff of a later topic,\nthey'll stick with us.\nThe best-studied use of this idea is the media computation approach\ndeveloped by Guzdial and Ericson at Georgia Tech\n[1].\nInstead of printing \"hello world\" or summing the first ten integers,\ntheir students' first program opens an image, resizes it to create at\nthumbnail, and saves the result. This is an authentic task,\ni.e., something that learners believe they would actually do in real\nlife. It is also tangible: if the image comes out the wrong\nsize, learners have a concrete starting point for debugging.\n\nStrategies for Motivating Learners\nHow Learning Works [2] contains a list of\nevidence-based methods to motivate learners.  None of them are\nsurprising–it's hard to imagine someone saying that we\nshouldn't identify and reward what we value–but it's\nuseful to check lessons against these points to make sure they're\ndoing at least a few of these things.\nWhat's missing from this list is strategies to motivate the\ninstructor. Learners respond to an instructor's enthusiasm, and\ninstructors need to care about a topic in order to keep teaching it,\nparticularly when they are volunteers.\n\nDemotivation\nIf you are teaching free-range learners, they are probably already\nmotivated–if they weren't, they wouldn't be in your classroom. The\nchallenge is therefore not to demotivate them.  Unfortunately, we can\ndo this by accident much more easily than you might think.\nThe three most powerful demotivators are unpredictability,\nindifference, and unfairness.\nFIXME: add material about unpredictability.\nIf learners believe that the instructor or the educational system\ndoesn't care about them or the lesson, they won't care either. And if\npeople believe the class is unfair, they will also be demotivated,\neven if it is unfair in their favor (because consciously or\nunconsciously they will worry that they will some day find themselves\nin the group on the losing end). Finally, a \"holier-than-thou\" or\ncontemptuous attitude from an instructor is a quick way to alienate a\nclassroom and cause learners to tune out.\nFIXME: add citations here [3]\nHere are some quick ways to demotivate your learners:\n\nTell learners they are rubbish because they use Excel and/or Word,\ndon't modularize their code, etc.\n\nRepeatedly make digs about Windows and praise Linux, e.g., say that\nthe former is for amateurs.\n\nCriticize GUI applications (and by implication their users) and\ndescribe command-line tools as the One True Way.\n\nDive into complex or detailed technical discussion with the one or\ntwo people in the audience who clearly don't actually need to be\nthere.\n\nPretend to know more than you do. People will actually trust you\nmore if you are frank about the limitations of your knowledge, and\nwill be more likely to ask questions and seek help.\n\nUse the J word (\"just\"). As discussed in Memory, this\nsignals to the learner that the instructor thinks their problem is\ntrivial and by extension that they therefore must be stupid for not\nbeing able to figure it out.\n\nFeign surprise. Saying things like \"I can't believe you don't know\nX\" or \"you've never heard of Y?\" signals to the learner that they\ndo not have some required pre-knowledge of the material you are\nteaching, that they are in the wrong place, and it may prevent them\nfrom asking questions in the future. (This idea comes from the\nRecurse Center's Social Rules).\n\n\n\nCode of Conduct Revisited\nAs noted in Welcome, we believe very strongly that\nclasses should have a Code of Conduct. Its details are important, but\nthe most important thing about it is that it exists: knowing that we\nhave rules tells people a great deal about our values and about what\nkind of learning experience they can expect.\n\n\n\nNever Learn Alone\nOne way to support at-risk learners of all kinds is to have people\nsign up for workshops in small teams rather than as individuals. If\nan entire lab group comes, or if attendees are drawn from the same\n(or closely-related) disciplines, everyone in the room will know in\nadvance that they will be with at least a few people they trust,\nwhich increases the chances of them actually coming. It also helps\nafter the workshop: if people come with their labmates, they can\nwork together to implement what they've learned.\nFIXME: define \"at-risk learners\" as those who have been on the\nreceiving end of systematic discrimination.\n\nImpostor Syndrome\nImpostor syndrome is the belief that one is\nnot good enough for a job or position, that one's achievements are\nlucky flukes, and an accompanying fear of being \"found out\". Impostor\nsyndrome seems to be particularly common among high achievers who\nundertake publicly visible work.\nAcademic work is frequently undertaken alone or in small groups but\nthe results are shared and criticized publicly. In addition, we rarely\nsee the struggles of others, only their finished work, which can feed\nthe belief that everyone else finds it easy. Women and minority\ngroups who already feel additional pressure to prove themselves in\nsome settings\nmay be particularly affected.\nTwo ways of dealing with your own impostor syndrome are:\n\nAsk for feedback from someone you respect and trust. Ask them for\ntheir honest thoughts on your strengths and achievements, and commit\nto believing them.\n\nLook for role models. Who do you know who presents as confident and\ncapable? Think about how they conduct themselves. What lessons can\nyou learn from them? What habits can you borrow? (Remember, they\nquite possibly also feel as if they are making it up as they go.)\n\n\nAs an instructor, you can help people with their impostor syndrome by\nsharing stories of mistakes that you have made or things you struggled\nto learn. This reassures the class that it's OK to find topics hard.\nBeing open with the group makes it easier to build trust and make\nstudents confident to ask questions. (Live coding is great for this:\ntypos let the class see you're not superhuman.)\nYou can also emphasize that you want questions: you are not succeeding\nas a teacher if no one can follow your class, so you're asking\nstudents for their help to help you learn and improve. Remember, it's\nmuch more important to be smart than to look smart.\nThe Ada Initiative has some excellent resources for\nteaching about and dealing with imposter syndrome.\nStereotype Threat\nReminding people of negative stereotypes, even in subtle ways, makes\nthem anxious about the risk of confirming those stereotypes, which in\nturn reduces their performance. This is called stereotype\nthreat, and the clearest examples in computing\nare gender-related.  Depending on whose numbers you trust, only 12-18%\nof programmers are women, and those figures have actually been getting\nworse over the last 20 years. There are many reasons for this (see\n[4] and [5]),\nand [6] summarizes what we know about stereotype\nthreat in general and presents some strategies for mitigating it in\nthe classroom.\nHowever, while there's lots of evidence that unwelcoming climates\ndemotivate members of under-represented groups, it's not clear that\nstereotype threat is the underlying mechanism. Part of the problem is\nthat the term has been used in many\nways; another is [questions about the\nreplicability of key studies][stereotype-thread-replicability]. What\nis clear is that we need to avoid thinking in terms of a deficit\nmodel (i.e., we need to change the members of under-represented groups\nbecause they have some deficit, such as lack of prior experience) and\ninstead use a systems approach (i.e., we need to change the system\nbecause it produces these disparities).\nFIXME: women aren't leaving computing because they don't know what\nit's like; they're leaving because they do know.\nA great example of how stereotypes work in general was presented in\nPatitsas et al's \"Evidence That Computer Science Grades Are Not\nBimodal\" [7].  This thought-provoking paper\nshowed that people see evidence for a \"geek gene\" where none exists.\nAs the paper's abstract says:\n\nAlthough it has never been rigorously demonstrated, there is a\ncommon belief that CS grades are bimodal. We statistically analyzed\n778 distributions of final course grades from a large research\nuniversity, and found only 5.8% of the distributions passed tests\nof multimodality. We then devised a psychology experiment to\nunderstand why CS educators believe their grades to be bimodal. We\nshowed 53 CS professors a series of histograms displaying ambiguous\ndistributions and asked them to categorize the distributions. A\nrandom half of participants were primed to think about the fact that\nCS grades are commonly thought to be bimodal; these participants\nwere more likely to label ambiguous distributions as \"bimodal\".\nParticipants were also more likely to label distributions as bimodal\nif they believed that some students are innately predisposed to do\nbetter at CS. These results suggest that bimodal grades are\ninstructional folklore in CS, caused by confirmation bias and\ninstructor beliefs about their students.\n\nIt's easy to use language that suggests that some people are natural\nprogrammers and others aren't, but Mark Guzdial has called this belief\nthe biggest myth about teaching computer science.\nMindset\nLearners can be demotivated in subtler ways as well. For example,\nDweck and others have studied the differences of fixed mindset and\ngrowth mindset. If people believe that competence\nin some area is intrinsic (i.e., that you either \"have the gene\" for\nit or you don't), everyone does worse, including the supposedly\nadvantaged.  The reason is that if they don't get it at first, they\nfigure they just don't have that aptitude, which biases future\nperformance. On the other hand, if people believe that a skill is\nlearned and can be improved, they do better on average.\nA person's mindset can be shaped by subtle cues. For example, if a\nchild is told, \"You did a good job, you must be very smart,\" she is\nlikely to develop a fixed mindset. If on the other hand she is told,\n\"You did a good job, you must have worked very hard,\" she is likely\nto develop a growth mindset, and subsequently achieve more. Studies\nhave also shown that the simple action of telling learners about the\ndifferent mindsets before a course can improve learning outcomes for\nthe whole group.\nAs with stereotype threat, there are\nconcerns that research on grown mindset has\nbeen oversold, or will be much more difficult to put into practice\nthan its more enthusiastic advocates have implied.  While some people\ninterpret this back and forth of claim and counter-claim as evidence\nthan education research isn't reliable, what it really shows is that\nanything involving human subjects is both subtle and difficult.\nAccessibility\nNot providing equal access to lessons and exercises is about as\ndemotivating as it gets. If you look at the old Software Carpentry\nlessons, for example, the text beside the slides\nincludes all of the narration–but none of the Python source code.\nSomeone using a screen reader\nwould therefore be able to hear what was being said about the program,\nbut wouldn't know what the program actually was.\nWhile it may not be possible to accommodate everyone's needs, it\nis possible to get a good working structure in place without any\nspecific knowledge of what specific disabilities people might have.\nHaving at least some accommodations prepared in advance also makes it\nclear that hosts and instructors care enough to have thought about\nproblems in advance, and that any additional concerns are likely to be\naddressed.\n\nIt Helps Everyone\nCurb cuts (the small sloped ramps joining a\nsidewalk to the street) were originally created to make it easier\nfor the physically disabled to move around, but proved to be equally\nhelpful to people with strollers and grocery carts.  Similarly,\nsteps taken to make lessons more accessible to people with various\ndisabilities also help everyone else. Proper captioning of images,\nfor example, doesn't just give screen readers something to say: it\nalso makes the images more findable by exposing their content to\nsearch engines.\n\nThe first and most important step in making lessons accessible is to\ninvolve people with disabilities in decision-making: the slogan\nnihil de nobis, sine nobis (literally, \"nothing\nabout us, without us\") predates accessibility rights, but is always\nthe right place to start.  A few other recommendations are:\n\nFind out what you need to do. The W3C Accessibility Initiative's\nchecklist for presentations is a good starting\npoint focused primarily on assisting the visually impaired, while\nLiz Henry's blog post about [accessibility at\nconferences][henry-accessibility] has a good checklist for people\nwith mobility issues, and this interview with\nChad Taylor is a good introduction to issues faced by the hearing\nimpaired.\n\nKnow how well you're doing. For example, sites like\nWebAIM allow you to check how accessible your online\nmaterials are to visually impaired users.\n\nDon't do everything at once. We don't ask learners in our\nworkshops to adopt all our best practices or tools in one go, but\ninstead to work things in gradually at whatever rate they can\nmanage.  Similarly, try to build in accessibility habits when\npreparing for workshops by adding something new each time.\n\nDo the easy things first. There are plenty of ways to make\nworkshops more accessible that are both easy and don't create extra\ncognitive load for anyone: font choices, general text size, checking\nin advance that your room is accessible via an elevator or ramp,\netc.\n\n\nInclusivity\nInclusivity is a policy of including people who might otherwise\nbe excluded or marginalized. In computing, it means making a positive\neffort to be more welcoming to women, people of color, people with\nvarious sexual orientations, the elderly, the physically challenged,\nthe formerly incarcerated, the economically disadvantaged, and\neveryone else who doesn't fit Silicon Valley's white/Asian male\ndemographic. Lee's paper \"What can I do today to create a more\ninclusive community in CS?\" [8]\nis a brief, practical guide to doing that with references to the\nresearch literature. These help learners who belong to one or more\nmarginalized or excluded groups, but help motivate everyone else as\nwell; while they are phrased in terms of term-long courses, many can\nbe applied in our workshops:\n\nAsk learners to email you before the workshop to explain how they\nbelieve the training could help them achieve their goals.\n\nReview notes to make sure they are free from gendered pronouns, that\nthey include culturally diverse names, etc.\n\nEmphasize that what matters is the rate at which they are learning,\nnot the advantages or disadvantages they had when they started.\n\nEncourage pair programming.\n\nActively mitigate behavior that some learners may find intimidating,\ne.g., use of jargon or \"questions\" that are actually asked to\ndisplay knowledge.\n\n\nChallenges\nSeveral of these challenges use \"think-pair-share\".  If you have not\nalready covered this, please look at the description\nnow.\nAuthentic Tasks\nThink about something you did this week that uses one or more of the\nskills you teach, (e.g., wrote a function, bulk downloaded data, did\nsome stats in R, forked a repo) and explain how you would use it (or a\nsimplified version of it) as an exercise or example in class.\nPair up with your neighbor and decide where this exercise fits on a\n2x2 grid of \"short/longtime to master\" and \"low/high\nusefulness\"?  In the shared notes, write the task and where it fits\non the grid. As a group, discuss how these relate back to the \"teach\nmost immediately useful first\" approach.\nPick One\nPick one activity or change in practice from Lee's paper\n[8] that you would like to work\non.  Put a reminder in your calendar three months in the future to\nself-check whether you have done something about it.\nBrainstorming Motivational Strategies\nThink back to a programming course (or any other) that you took in the\npast, and identify one thing the instructor did that motivated you.\nPair up with your neighbor and discuss it, and then share the story in\nthe group notes.\nDemotivational Experiences\nThink back to a time when you demotivated a student (or when you were\ndemotivated as a student). Pair up with your neighbor and discuss what\nyou could have done differently in the situation, and then share the\nstory and what could have been done in the group notes.\nWalk the Route\nFind the nearest public transportation drop-off point to your building\nand walk from there to your office and then to the nearest washroom,\nmaking notes about things you think would be difficult for someone with\nmobility issues. Now borrow a wheelchair and repeat the journey. How\ncomplete was your list of challenges? And did you notice that the first\nsentence in this challenge assumed you could actually walk?\nWho Decides?\nIn Littky and Grabelle's The Big Picture: Education is Everyone's\nBusiness [9], Kenneth Wesson wrote, \"If\npoor inner-city children consistently outscored children from wealthy\nsuburban homes on standardized tests, is anyone naive enough to\nbelieve that we would still insist on using these tests as indicators\nof success?\" What are examples in your own experience of \"objective\"\nassessments that reinforce the status quo?\n\n1Mark Guzdial, Exploring Hypotheses About Media Computation, Proceedings of the Ninth Annual International ACM Conference on International Computing Education Research, ACM, 2013.2Susan A.

Don’t take over from the learner,\ninstead talk them through it.  When you do it, it’s magic, when they\ndo it, they know at least what was done.\nFIXME: Confessional debugging.  Useful for them post-workshop.  If\nyour program doesn’t work, explain the problem aloud to your\ncat/dog/rubber duck, and often the problem and solution become clear.\nFIXME: I get the feeling that your workshops usually involve many\nsmall exercises.  In our Greenfoot workshops we tend to work on\nbuilding up one program over several hours.  For this purpose, I\nusually do backwards design: start with the final program I want\nlearners to finish with.  Then I remove the most complex part (that I\nactually want them to write) and make that the last exercise.  Then\nremove the second most complex part, which is the penultimate\nexercise.  And so on, until I’ve removed one of the easiest parts I\nwant them to write.  Any remaining code is boilerplate which I don’t\nwant them to write, and that forms the starting file(s) which I give\nout.  (You could say that ideally this is blank, but often you just\nhave some stuff you need, e.g. import statements or helper functions,\nwhich you need to give them but which you’re not going to get them to\nwrite.\nFIXME: Relatedly, we use a principle “Never a blank page” for our\nwork, on the basis that blank pages are intimidating, whereas\nmodifying some existing code is more realistic and gives some initial\nstructure.  Obviously there’s a tension here, as giving existing code\nincreases cognitive load and learners can get distracted trying to\nunderstand it all.\nHave a Code of Conduct\nAn important part of making a class productive is to treat everyone\nwith respect.  We therefore strongly recommend that every group\noffering classes based on this material adopt a Code of Conduct like\nthe one in Conduct, and require people taking part in\nthe class to abide by it.\nWe believe equally strongly that your actual programming classes\nshould also have and enforce a Code of Conduct.  Programming is a\nscary topic for many novices, and workshops are meant to be a judgment\nfree space to learn and experiment. The behavior of the instructor and\nother participants may make more of an impression on a novice learner\nthan any \"technical\" topic you teach.\nIf you do this, hosts should point people at it during registration,\nand instructors should remind attendees of it at the start of the\nworkshop. The Code of Conduct doesn't just tell everyone what the\nrules are: it tells them that there are rules, and that they\ncan therefore expect a safe and welcoming learning experience.\nIf you are an instructor, and believe that someone in a workshop has\nviolated the Code of Conduct, you may warn them, ask them to\napologize, and/or expel them, depending on the severity of the\nviolation and whether or not you believe it was intentional.  Whatever\nyou do:\n\nDo it in front of witnesses.  Most people will tone down their\nlanguage and hostility in front of an audience, and having someone\nelse present ensures that later discussion doesn't degenerate into\nconflicting claims about who said what.\n\nContact the organizer or host of your class as soon as you can and\ndescribe what happened.  Remember, a Code of Conduct is meaningless\nwithout a procedure for enforcing it.\n\n\nA Code of Conduct cannot stop people from being offensive, any more\nthan laws against theft stop people from stealing. What it can\ndo is make expectations and consequences clear.  In our experience,\npeople rarely violate the Code of Conduct in person, though some are\nmore likely to online, where they feel less inhibited.  And remember,\na Code of Conduct is not an infringement on free speech.\nPeople have a right to say what they think, but that doesn't mean they\nhave a right to speak wherever and whenever they want.  If someone\nwishes to say something disparaging about someone else, they can go\nand find a space of their own in which to say it.\nTake Notes Together\nMany studies have shown that taking notes while learning improves\nretention [1],\n[2].  As discussed in\nMemory, this happens because taking notes forces you to\norganize and reflect on material as it's coming in, which in turn\nincreases the likelihood that you will transfer it to long-term memory\nin a usable way.\nOur experience, and some recent research findings, lead us to believe\nthat taking notes collaboratively helps learning even\nmore [3], even though taking notes on a\ncomputer is generally less effective than taking notes using pen and\npaper [4].  Taking notes collaboratively:\n\nIt allows people to compare what they think they're hearing with\nwhat other people are hearing, which helps them fill in gaps and\ncorrect misconceptions right away.\n\nIt gives the more advanced learners in the class something useful to\ndo.  Rather than getting bored and checking Twitter during class,\nthey often take the lead in recording what's being said, which keeps\nthem engaged, and allows less advanced learners to focus more of\ntheir attention on new material.  Keeping the more advanced learners\nbusy also helps the whole class stay engaged because boredom is\ninfectious: if a handful of people start updating their Facebook\nprofiles, the people around them will start checking out too.\n\nThe notes the learners take are usually more helpful to them\nthan those the instructor would prepare in advance, since the learners\nare more likely to write down what they actually found new, rather than\nwhat the instructor predicted would be new.\n\nGlancing at the notes as they're being taken helps the instructor\ndiscover that the class didn't hear something important, or\nmisunderstood it.\n\n\nWe usually use Etherpad for collaborative\nnote-taking, though many instructors have shifted to\nGoogle Docs, both because it scales\nbetter and because it allows people to add images to the notes.\nWhichever is chosen, classes also use it to share snippets of code and\nsmall datasets, and as a way for learners to show instructors their\nwork (by copying and pasting it in).\nShared note-taking is almost always mentioned positively in\npost-workshop feedback.  However, it's also common for participants to\nreport that they find it distracting, as it's one more thing they have\nto keep an eye on.  We believe the positives outweigh the negatives,\nbut think that some careful controlled studies would tell us whether\nwe're right, and how to use it better.\nAssess Learners' Motivation and Prior Knowledge\nMost formal educational systems train people to treat all assessment\nas summative, i.e., to think of every interaction with a teacher as an\nevaluation, rather than as a chance to shape instruction.  For\nexample, we use a short pre-assessment questionnaire to profile\nlearners before workshops to help instructors tune the pace and level\nof material. We send this questionnaire out after people have\nregistered rather than making it part of the sign-up process because\nwhen we did the latter, many people concluded that since they couldn't\nanswer all the questions, they shouldn't enrol. We were therefore\nscaring off many of the people we most wanted to help.\nInstead of asking people how easily they could complete specific\ntasks, we could just ask them to rate their knowledge of various\nsubjects on a scale from 1 to 5. However, self-assessments of this\nkind are usually inaccurate because of the Dunning-Kruger\neffect: the less people know about a\nsubject, the less accurate their estimate of their knowledge is.\nThat said, there are things we can do:\n\nBefore running a workshop, communicate its level clearly to everyone\nwho's thinking of signing up by listing the topics that will be\ncovered and showing a few examples of exercises that people will be\nasked to complete.\n\nProvide multiple exercises for each teaching episode so that more\nadvanced learners don't finish early and get bored.\n\nAsk more advanced learners to help people next to them. They'll\nlearn from answering their peers' questions (since it will force\nthem to think about things in new ways).\n\nThe helpers and the instructor who isn't teaching the particular\nepisode should keep an eye out for learners who are falling behind\nand intervene early so that they don't become frustrated and give\nup.\n\n\nThe most important thing is to accept that no class can possibly meet\neveryone's individual needs. If the instructor slows down to accommodate\ntwo people who are struggling, the other 38 are not being well served.\nEqually, if she spends a few minutes talking about an advanced topic\nbecause two learners are bored, the 38 who don't understand it will feel\nleft out. All we can do is tell our learners what we're doing and why,\nand hope that they'll understand.\nIt's important to design lessons with a particular audience in mind.\nIt's equally important to find out who's in each specific audience,\nsince this will influence how you introduce yourself, motivate topics,\nand pace the lessons.  Before the start of a Software Carpentry\ninstructor training class, we ask people to fill in a short\nquestionnaire like the one below.  It doesn't tell us everything we\nmight want to know, but it does give trainers a pretty clear idea of\nwho they're speaking to.\n\nHave you ever participated in a Software Carpentry or Data Carpentry\nworkshop? (Check all that apply.)\n\nYes, as a learner.\nYes, as a helper.\nYes, as an organizer.\nYes, as an instructor.\nNo, but I am familiar with what is taught at a workshop.\nNo, and I am not familiar with what is taught at a workshop.\n\n\nWhich of these describes your teaching experience?  (Check all that\napply.)\n\nI have none.\nI have taught a seminar, workshop, or other short or informal course.\nI have been a graduate or undergraduate teaching assistant for a\ncollege- or university-level course.\nI have been the instructor-of-record for a college- or\nuniversity-level course.\nI have taught at the K-12 level.\n\n\nWhich of these describes your previous formal training in teaching?\n(Please choose only one.)\n\nNone\nA few hours\nA workshop\nA certification or short course\nA full degree\n\n\nHow frequently do you work with the tools that Data Carpentry and\nSoftware Carpentry teach, such as R, Python, MATLAB, Perl, SQL, Git,\nOpenRefine, and the Unix Shell?\n\nEvery day\nA few times a week\nA few times a month\nA few times a year\nNever or almost never\n\n\nHow often would you expect to teach on Software or Data Carpentry\nWorkshops after this training?\n\nNot at all\nOnce a year\nSeveral times a year\n\n\nWhy do you want to take this training course?\n\n\nUse Sticky Notes as Status Flags\nGive each learner two sticky notes of different colours, e.g., red and\ngreen. These can be held up for voting, but their real use is as\nstatus flags. If someone has completed an exercise and wants it\nchecked, they put the green sticky note on their laptop; if they run\ninto a problem and need help, the put up the red one. This is better\nthan having people raise their hands because:\n\nit's more discreet (which means they're more likely to\nactually do it),\n\nthey can keep working while their flag is raised, and\n\nthe instructor can quickly see from the front of the room what\nstate the class is in.\n\n\nSometimes a red sticky involves a technical problem that takes a bit\nmore time to solve. To prevent this issue from slowing down the whole\nclass too much, you could use the occasion to take the small break you\nhad planned to take a bit later, giving the helper(s) time to fix the\nproblem.\nUse Sticky Notes to Distribute Attention\nFIXME: Sticky notes to distribute attention\nMinute Cards\nWe frequently use sticky notes as minute cards: before each\nbreak, learners take a minute to write one positive thing on the green\nsticky note (e.g., one thing they've learned that they think will be\nuseful), and one thing they found too fast, too slow, confusing, or\nirrelevant on the red one. They can use the red sticky note for\nquestions that haven't yet been answered. While they are enjoying\ntheir coffee or lunch, the instructors review and cluster these to\nfind patterns. It only takes a few minutes to see what learners are\nenjoying, what they still find confusing, what problems they're\nhaving, and what questions are still unanswered.\nOne Up, One Down\nWe frequently ask for summary feedback at the end of each day. The\ninstructors ask the learners to alternately give one positive and one\nnegative point about the day, without repeating anything that has\nalready been said. This requirement forces people to say things they\notherwise might not: once all the \"safe\" feedback has been given,\nparticipants will start saying what they really think.\nMinute cards are anonymous; the alternating up-and-down feedback is not.\nEach mode has its strengths and weaknesses, and by providing both, we\nhope to get the best of both worlds.\nPair Programming\nPair programming is a good practice in real life, and also a good way\nto teach [5]. Partners can not only help each\nother out during the practical, but can also clarify each other's\nmisconceptions when the solution is presented, and discuss common\nresearch interests during breaks. To facilitate this, we strongly\nprefer flat (dinner-style) seating to banked (theater-style) seating;\nthis also makes it easier for helpers to reach learners who need\nassistance.\nWhen pair programming is used it's important to put everyone in\npairs, not just the learners who are struggling, so that no one feels\nsingled out. It's also useful to have people sit in new places (and\nhence pair with different partners) after each coffee or meal break.\nPeer Instruction\nNo matter how good a teacher is, she can only say one thing at a time.\nHow then can she clear up many different misconceptions in a\nreasonable time?\nThe best solution developed so far is a technique called *[peer\ninstruction][wikipedia-peer-instruction]. Originally created by Eric\nMazur at Harvard, it has been studied extensively in a wide variety of\ncontexts, including programming [5]. Peer\ninstruction combines formative assessment with student discussion and\nlooks something like this:\n\nGive a brief introduction to the topic.\n\nGive students an MCQ that probes for misconceptions (rather than\nsimple factual knowledge).\n\nHave all the students vote on their answers to the MCQ.\n\nIf the students all have the right answer, move on.\nIf they all have the same wrong answer, address that specific\nmisconception.\nIf they have a mix of right and wrong answers, give them several\nminutes to discuss those answers with one another in small groups\n(typically 2-4 students) and then reconvene and vote again.\n\n\n\nAs [this video][video-peer-instruction] shows, group discussion\nsignificantly improves students' understanding because it forces them\nto clarify their thinking, which can be enough to call out gaps in\nreasoning. Re-polling the class then lets the instructor know if they\ncan move on, or if further explanation is necessary. A final round of\nadditional explanation and discussion after the correct answer is\npresented gives students one more chance to solidify their\nunderstanding.\nPeer instruction is essentially a way to provide one-to-one mentorship\nin a scalable way. Despite this, we usually do not use it in our\nworkshops because it takes people time to adapt to a new way of\nlearning–time that we typically don't have in our compressed two-day\nformat.\nFIXME: make it clear that the comment above is about actual classes,\nnot instructor training workshops.\nFIXME: important to have learners record their votes so that they\ncan't change their minds afterward and rationalize it (making\nexcuses to themselves like \"I just misread the question\") - value\ncomes from the jarring experience of having their answer be wrong.\nSetting Up Your Learners\nLearners tell us that it is important to them to leave the workshop\nwith their own machine set up to do real work. We therefore continue\nto teach on all three major platforms (Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows),\neven though it would be simpler to require learners to use just one.\nFIXME: Talk about getting learners' machines set up.\n\nVirtual Machines\nWe have experimented with virtual machines (VMs) on learners'\ncomputers to reduce installation problems, but those introduce\nproblems of their own: older or smaller machines simply aren't fast\nenough, and learners often struggle to switch back and forth between\ntwo different sets of keyboard shortcuts for things like copying and\npasting.\nSome instructors use VPS over SSH or web browser pages instead. This\nsolve the installation issues, but makes us dependent on host\ninstitutions' WiFi (which can be of highly variable quality), and has\nthe issues mentioned above with things like keyboard shortcuts.\n\nSetting Up Your Own Enviornment\nFIXME: target here for forward ref from performance section about\nsetting up your environment, e.g., having a glass of water to give\nyourself time to think.  Also talk about how it's OK to face away\nfrom your audience for a few moments to write on the board or walk\nthrough code, as long as it's only for a few moments.\nCough Drops\nFIXME: explain cough drops.\nTeaching Online\nMany learners find it difficult to get to a workshop, either because\nthere isn't one locally or because it's difficult to schedule time\naround other commitments, so why don't we create video recordings of\nthe lessons and offer the workshop as a MOOC (Massive Open Online\nCourse)?\nThe first answer is that we did in 2010-11, but found the maintenance\ncosts unsustainable. Making a small change to this webpage only takes\na few minutes. but making any change to a video takes an hour\nor more. In addition, most people are much less comfortable recording\nthemselves than contributing written material.\nThe second answer is that doing outperforms watching.  Specifically, a\nrecent paper by Koedinger et al [6]\nestimated \"…the learning benefit from extra doing (1 SD increase) to\nbe more than six times that of extra watching or reading.\" \"Doing\", in\nthis case, refers to completing an interactive or mimetic task with\nfeedback, while \"benefit\" refers to both \"completion rates\" and\n\"overall performance\".\nAnd while we do not (yet) have empirical data, we believe very\nstrongly that many novices would give up in despair if required to\ndebug setup and installation lessons on their own, but are more likely\nto get past these obstacles if someone is present to help them.\nAn intermediate approach that has proven quite successful is real-time\nremote instruction, in which the learners are co-located at one (or a\nfew) sites, with helpers present, while the instructor(s) teaching via\nonline video. This model has worked well for this instructor training\ncourse, and for a handful of regular workshops, but more work is\nneeded to figure out its pros and cons.\nThink-Pair-Share\nThink-pair-share is a lightweight technique that helps refine their\nideas and compare them with others'.  Each person starts by thinking\nindividually about a question or problem and jotting down a few notes.\nParticipants are then paired to explain their ideas to each another,\nand possibly to merge them or select the more interesting ones.\nFinally, a few pairs present their ideas to the whole group.\nThink-pair-share works because, to paraphrase Oscar Wilde's Lady\nWindermere, people often can't know what they're thinking until\nthey've heard themselves say it.  Pairing gives people new insight\ninto their own thinking, and forces them to think through and resolve\nany gaps or contradictions before exposing their ideas to a\nlarger group.\nChallenges\nCreate a Questionnaire\nUsing the questionnaire shown earlier as a template, create\na short questionnaire you could give learners before teaching a class\nof your own.  What do you most want to know about their background?\n\n1Edwin G. Aiken and Gary S. Thomas and William A.

When they are live\ncoding, instructors don't use slides.  Instead, they through the\nlesson material, typing in the code or instructions, with their\nlearners following along.  Its advantages are:\n\nWatching a program being written is more compelling than watching\nsomeone page through slides that present bits and pieces of the same\ncode.\n\nIt enables instructors to be more responsive to \"what if?\"\nquestions. Where a slide deck is like a railway track, live coding\nallows instructors to go off road and follow their learners'\ninterests.\n\nIt facilitates lateral knowledge transfer: people learn more than we\nrealized we were teaching by watching how instructors do\nthings.\n\nIt slows the instructor down: if she has to type in the program as\nshe goes along, she can only go twice as fast as her learners,\nrather than ten-fold faster as she could with slides.\n\nLearners get to see instructors' mistakes and how to diagnose\nand correct them. Novices are going to spend most of their time\ndoing this, but it's left out of most textbooks.\n\nWatching instructors make mistakes shows learners that it's all\nright to make mistakes of their.  Most people model the behavior of\ntheir teachers: if the instructor isn't embarrassed about making and\ntalking about mistakes, learners will be more comfortable doing so\ntoo.\n\n\n\nFIXME: downsides of live coding from Neil Brown are:\n\nToo slow, either too slow typing or spending too much time\nlooking at notes to try to remember what they meant to type in\n\nSpending time typing in boilerplate.  Willingham says \"Memory is\nthe residue of thought\" [1] and\nif you spend your time typing boilerplate (import statements, helper\nfunctions which are not of interest, try/catch blocks when the\nlesson is not about exceptions).\n\n\nAdd (a) know what you're going to type in, perhaps have the exact\nfinal code printed out or on a tablet nearby and (b) make sure you\nare live coding the interesting part.  If uninteresting, have it\npre-entered, or have it ready to copy and paste at the point you\nneed it, explaining to audience why they don't need to pay attention\nto that part.\nIf you've given a lesson several times, you're unlikely to make\nanything other than basic typing mistakes (which usually aren't\ninformative). It's worth remembering \"real\" mistakes and making them\ndeliberately, but that often feels forced.  A better approach is to\nget learners to tell you what to do next (\"twitch coding\") in the\nhope that this will get you into the weeds.\n\nLive coding is an example of the \"I/We/You\" approach to teaching\ndiscussed in Performance.  It takes a bit of practice\nfor instructors to get used to thinking aloud while coding in front of\nan audience, but most report that it is then no more difficult to do\nthan talking off a deck of slides.\n\nDouble Devices\nMany instructors now use two devices when teaching: a laptop plugged\ninto the projector for learners to see, and a tablet beside it on\nwhich they can view their notes and the shared notes that the learners\nare taking.  This seems to be more reliable than displaying one\nvirtual desktop while flipping back and forth to another.\n\nHere are some tips to make your live coding better:\n\nBe seen and heard.  If you are physically able to stand up\nfor a couple of hours, do it while you are teaching. When you sit\ndown, you are hiding yourself behind others for those sitting in the\nback rows. Make sure to notify the workshop organizers of your wish\nto stand up and ask them to arrange a high table, standing desk, or\nlectern.\nRegardless of whether you are standing or sitting, make sure to move\naround as much as reasonable. You can for example go to the screen\nto point something out, or draw something on the white/blackboard\n(see below). Moving around makes the teaching more lively, less\nmonotonous.  It draws the learners' attention away from their\nscreens, to you, which helps get the point you are making across.\nEven though you may have a good voice and know how to use it well,\nit may be a good idea to use a microphone, especially if the\nworkshop room is equipped with one. Your voice will be less tired,\nand you increase the chance of people with hearing difficulties\nbeing able to follow the workshop.\n\nTake it slow.  For every command you type, every word of code\nyou write, every menu item or website button you click, say out loud\nwhat you are doing while you do it. Then point to the command and\nits output on the screen and go through it a second time. This not\nonly slows you down, it allows learners who are following along to\ncopy what you do, or to catch up, even when they are looking at\ntheir screen while doing it. If the output of your command or code\nmakes what you just typed disappear from view, scroll back up so\nlearners can see it again - this is especially needed for the Unix\nshell lesson.\nOther options are to execute the same command a second time, or to\ncopy and paste the last command(s) into the workshop's shared notes.\n\nMirror your learner's environment as much as possible.  You\nmay have set up your environment to your liking, with a very simple\nor rather fancy Unix prompt, colour schemes for your development\nenvironment, keyboard shortcuts etc. Your learners usually won't\nhave all of this. Try to create an environment that mirrors what\nyour learners have, and avoid using keyboard shortcuts. Some\ninstructors create a separate bare-bone' user (login) account on\ntheir laptop, or a separateteaching-only' account on the service\nbeing taught (e.g., Github).\n\nUse the screen wisely. Use a big font, and maximize the\nwindow. A black font on a lightly-tinted background works better\nthan a light font on a dark background.\nFIXME: explain why lightly-tinted and why not light on dark.\nWhen the bottom of the projector screen is at the same height, or\nbelow, the heads of the learners, people in the back won't be able\nto see the lower parts. Draw up the bottom of your window(s) to\ncompensate.\nIf you can get a second screen, use it: the extra screen real\nestate will allow you to have your code and its behavior side by\nside.\nFIXME: explain this point better.\nIt will usually require its own PC or laptop, so you may\nneed to ask a helper to control it. You could use the second\nscreen to show the Etherpad content, or the lesson material, or\nillustrations.\nPay attention to the lighting (not too dark, no lights directly\non/above the presenter's screen) and if needed, reposition the\ntables so all learners can see the screen, and helpers can easily\nreach all learners.\n\nUse illustrations.  Most lesson material comes with\nillustrations, and these may help learners to understand the stages\nof the lesson and to organize the material. What can work really\nwell is when you as instructor generate the illustrations on the\nwhite/blackboard as you progress through the material. This allows\nyou to build up diagrams, making them increasingly complex in\nparallel with the material you are teaching. It helps learners\nunderstand the material, makes for a more lively workshop (you'll\nhave to move between your laptop and the blackboard) and gathers the\nlearners' attention to you as well.\n\nAvoid distractions.  Turn off any notifications you may use\non your laptop, such as those from social media, email, etc. Seeing\nnotifications flash by on the screen distracts you as well as the\nlearners - and may even result in awkward situations when a message\npops up you'd rather not have others see.\n\nImprovise after you know the material.  The first time you\nteach a new lesson, you should stick fairly closely to the topics it\nlays out and the order they're in.  It may be tempting to deviate\nfrom the material because you would like to show a neat trick, or\ndemonstrate some alternative way of doing something. Don't do this,\nsince there is a fair chance you'll run into something unexpected\nthat you then have to explain.\nOnce you are more familiar with the material, though, you can and\nshould start improvising based on the backgrounds of your learners,\ntheir questions in class, and what you find most interesting about\nthe lesson.  This is like a musician playing a new song: the first\nfew times, you stick to the sheet music, but after you're\ncomfortable with it, you can start to put your own stamp on it.\nIf you really want to use something outside of the material, try it\nout thoroughly before the workshop: run through the lesson as you\nwould during the actual teaching and test the effect of your\nmodification.\nSome instructors use printouts of the lesson material during\nteaching.  Others use a second device (tablet or laptop) when\nteaching, on which they can view their own notes and the shared\nnotes the learners are taking. This seems to be more reliable than\ndisplaying one virtual desktop while flipping back and forth to\nanother.\n\nEmbrace mistakes.\nNo matter how well prepared you are, you will be making\nmistakes. Typo's are hard to avoid, you may overlook something from\nthe lesson instructions, etc. This is OK! It allows learners to see\ninstructors' mistakes and how to diagnose and correct them. Some\nmistakes are actually an opportunity to point something out, or\nreflect back on something covered earlier. Novices are going to\nspend most of their time making the same and other mistakes, but how\nto deal with them is left out of most textbooks.\n\nThe typos are the pedagogy.– Emily Jane McTavish\n\n\nFIXME: it's OK to face the screen occasionally (ref back to\ncomment in practices section about this).\n\nHave fun. Teaching is performance art and can be rather serious\nbusiness. On the one hand, don't let this scare you - it is much\neasier than performing Hamlet. You have an excellent script at\nyour disposal, after all! On the other hand, it is OK to add an\nelement of play, i.e. use humor and improvisation to liven up the\nworkshop. How much you are able and willing to do this is really a\nmatter of personality and taste - as well as experience. It\nbecomes easier when you are more familiar with the material,\nallowing you to relax more. Choose your words and actions wisely,\nthough. Remember that we want the learners to have a welcoming\nexperience and a positive learning environment - a misplaced joke\ncan ruin this in an instant. Start small, even just saying `that\nwas fun' after something worked well is a good start. Ask your\nco-instructors and helpers for feedback when you are unsure of the\neffect your behaviour has on the workshop.\n\n\n\nFIXME\nAnother tip that might be useful to put somewhere: if you have\nparticipants on multiple OSes, it might be worth pointing out any\nfeatures which are OS-specific to avoid confusing learners on other\nOSes.  For example, Michael records Greenfoot videos on Mac, and\nI've seen one commenter say they don't have the red/yellow/green\nicons at the top of the window and ask if this is an issue.  That's\nmore cosmetic, but I imagine there's all sorts of gotchas elsewhere\n(e.g. Mac's shell commands are the BSD versions which have less\ncommand line arguments than the GNU versions you'd find on Linux).\n\nChallenges\nThe Bad and the Good\nWatch this video of live coding done poorly and\nthen this video of live coding done well as a\ngroup and then summarize your feedback on both using the usual 2×2\ngrid.  These videos assume learners know what a shell variable is,\nknow how to use the head command, and are familiar with the contents\nof the data files being filtered.\nSee Then Do\nTeach 3-4 minutes of your chosen lesson episode using live coding to a\nfellow trainee, then swap and watch while that person live codes for\nyou. Don't bother trying to record the live coding sessions–we have\nfound that it's difficult to capture both the person and the screen\nwith a handheld device–but give feedback the same way you have\npreviously (positive and negative, content and presentation). If you\ndecide to instead teach something from the lesson episode you selected\nin preparation for this workshop, explain in advance to your fellow\ntrainee what you will be teaching and what the learners you teach it\nto are expected to be familiar with.\n\nWhat felt different about live coding (vs.~standing up and\nlecturing)? What was harder/easier?\n\nDid you make any mistakes? If so, how did you handle them?\n\nDid you talk and type at the same time, or alternate?\n\nHow often did you point at the screen? How often did you highlight\nwith the mouse?\n\nWhat will you try to do differently next time?\n\n\n\n1Daniel T. Willingham, Why Don't Students Like School?, Jossey-Bass, 2010.\n"},"next.html":{"url":"next.html","title":"Why I Teach","keywords":"","body":"Why I Teach\nWhen I first started volunteering at the University of Toronto, students\noccasionally asked me why. This was my answer:\n\nWhen I was your age, I thought universities existed to teach people\nhow to learn. Later, in grad school, I thought universities were about\ndoing research and creating new knowledge. Now that I'm in my forties,\nthough, I've realized that what we're really teaching you is how to\ntake over the world, because you're going to have to one day whether\nyou like it or not.\nMy parents are in their seventies. They don't run the world any more;\nit's people my age who pass laws, set interest rates, and make\nlife-and-death decisions in hospitals. As scary as it may be, we've\nbecome the grownups.\nTwenty years from now, though, we'll be heading for retirement and\nyou will be in charge, because there won't be anyone else to do it.\nThat may sound like a long time when you're nineteen, but let me tell\nyou, take three breaths and it's gone. That's why we give you problems\nwhose answers can't be cribbed from last year's notes. That's why we\nput you in situations where you have to figure out what needs to be\ndone right now, what can be left for later, and what you can simply\nignore. It's because if you don't start learning how to do these\nthings now, you won't be ready to do them when you have to.\n\nIt was stirring stuff, but it wasn't the whole story. I didn't just\nwant my students to make the world a better place so that I could\nretire in comfort. I want them to make it a better place because it's\nthe great adventure of our time. Just think: a hundred and fifty years\nago, most societies still practiced slavery. A hundred years ago, when\nmy grandmother was young, she wasn't legally a person in\nCanada.  Fifty years ago, most of the world's people suffered under\ntotalitarian rule; in the year I was born, judges could---and\ndid---order electroshock therapy to \"cure\" homosexuals. Yes, there's\nstill a lot wrong with the world, but look at how many more choices we\nhave than our grandparents did. Look at how many more things we can\nknow, and be, and enjoy. And most importantly, look at how many other\npeople can too.\nThis didn't happen by chance. It happened because millions of us made\nmillions of little decisions, the sum of which was a better world. We\ndon't think of these day-to-day decisions as political, but every time\nwe buy one brand of running shoe instead of another or shout an\nanatomical insult instead of a racial one at a cab driver, we're\nchoosing one vision of the world instead of another. We don't think\nabout this bigger picture most of the time, but the last century and a\nhalf shows that once enough people make \"doing the right thing\" a habit,\nthe big picture more or less takes care of itself.\nAt least, that's what I believed in 2004. I am less optimistic today.\nOne upside of nuclear apocalypse from a preventive point of view was\nthat the people pushing the buttons would pay the price. The bill for my\ngeneration's cowardice, lethargy, and greed, on the other hand, won't\ncome due 'til my daughter is grown, by which point there will be no easy\nsolutions (and quite possibly no solutions at all). The only things that\nwill save us then will be more science and more courage, both of which\nneed to be taught and practiced. Insisting on evidence, and then\nacting on it when the cost is immediate and the reward delayed,\nrequires as great a social change as emancipation or universal suffrage.\nIn his 1947 essay \"Why I Write\", George Orwell\nsaid:\n\nIn a peaceful age I might have written ornate or merely descriptive\nbooks, and might have remained almost unaware of my political\nloyalties. As it is I have been forced into becoming a sort of\npamphleteer… Every line of serious work that I have written since\n1936 has been written, directly or indirectly, against\ntotalitarianism… It seems to me nonsense, in a period like our own,\nto think that one can avoid writing of such subjects. Everyone writes\nof them in one guise or another. It is simply a question of which side\none takes…\n\nReplace \"writing\" with \"teaching\" and you'll have the reason I've done\nwhat I've done for the last thirteen years. The world doesn't get\nbetter on its own. It gets better because people make it better:\npenny by penny, vote by vote, and one lesson at a time.\n\n\n"},"CONDUCT.html":{"url":"CONDUCT.html","title":"Code of Conduct","keywords":"","body":"Code of Conduct\n\nTo make clear what is expected, everyone participating in this class\nis required to conform to the following Code of Conduct.

It touches\non everything from the neuropsychology of perception and the\nmechanisms of memory to the sociology of school systems and the\nphilosophical question of what we actually mean by \"learning\" (which\nturns out to be pretty complicated once you start looking beyond the\nstandardized Western classroom). Within the broad scope of educational\npsychology, two specific perspectives have primarily influenced our\nteaching practices (and by extension, this instructor training).\nThe first perspective is cognitivism, which treats learning as a\nproblem in neuropsychology. Cognitivists focus their attention on\nthings like pattern recognition, memory formation, and recall. It is\ngood at answering low-level questions, but generally ignores larger\nissues like, \"What do we mean by 'learning'?\" and, \"Who gets to\ndecide?\"\nThe second perspective is situated\nlearning, which focuses on how\nlegitimate peripheral participation leads to\npeople becoming members of a [community of practice].\nUnpacking those terms, the situated learning perspective focuses on the\ntransition from being a newcomer to being accepted as a peer by those\nwho already do the activity in question. Situated learning is directly\nrelevant to our learners, many of whom ease into scientific computing by\ndoing small tasks that experienced practitioners would regard as\nstraightforward, but who learn how to take on bigger and more novel\nchallenges both from what they do and from the feedback (and welcome) it\nelicits. It is equally relevant to our instructors (i.e., you), who are\napproaching evidence-based teaching in the same way.\nFor example, Software and Data Carpentry aim to serve researchers who\nare exploring data management and programming on their own (legitimate\nperipheral practice) and make them aware of other people doing that\nwork (simply by attending the workshop) and the best practices and\nideas of that community of practice, thereby giving them a way to\nbecome members of that community. Situated learning thus describes why\nwe teach, and recognizes that teaching and learning is necessarily\nrooted in a social context. We then depend on the cognitivist\nperspective to drive how we teach the specific content associated\nwith the community of practice.\n\nOther Perspectives\nThere are many other perspectives outside cognitivist theory—see this\nsite for summaries. Besides cognitivism, those\nencountered most frequently include behaviorism (which treats\neducation as stimulus/response conditioning), constructivism (which\nconsiders learning an active process during which learners construct\nknowledge for themselves), connectivism (which emphasizes the social\naspects of learning, particularly those made possible by the\nInternet), and connectionism, a cognitivist theory that explains\nlearning as creating connections between concepts.  And yes, it would\nhelp if their names were less similar…\n\nEducational psychology does not tell us how to teach on its own\nbecause it under-constrains the problem: in real life, several\ndifferent teaching methods might be consistent with what we currently\nknow about how learning works. We therefore have to try those methods\nin the class, with actual learners, in order to find out how well they\nbalance the different forces in play. This is called instructional\ndesign (ID).  If educational psychology is the science, ID is the\nengineering.\nFIXME: more on ID\nIn the end, effective teaching often depends on what the teacher knows.\nThe things teachers know can be divided into:\n\ncontent knowledge, such as the \"what\" of programming;\n\ngeneral pedagogical knowledge, i.e., an understanding of the\npsychology of learning; and\n\nthe pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) that connects the two. PCK\nis things like what examples to use when teaching how parameters are\npassed to a function, or what misconceptions about wildcard\nexpansion are most common.\n\n\nFIXME: more on PCK\nA great example of PCK is Gelman and Nolan's [Teaching Statistics: A\nBag of Tricks] [1], which is full of PCK for\nteaching introductory statistics.  The CS Teaching\nTips site is gathering similar ideas for computing.\nMyths\nOne well-known scheme characterizes\nlearners as visual, auditory, or kinesthetic according to whether they\nlike to see things, hear things, or do things. This scheme is easy to\nunderstand, but as de Bruyckere and colleagues point out in Urban\nMyths About Learning and Education\n[2], it is almost certainly false.\nUnfortunately, that hasn't stopped a large number of companies from\nmarketing products based on it to parents and school boards.\nThis is not the only myth to plague education. The learning pyramid\nthat shows we remember 10% of what we read, 20% of what we hear, and\nso on?  Myth. The idea that \"brain games\" can improve our\nintelligence, or at least slow its decline in old age? Also a myth, as\nare the claims that the Internet is making us dumber or that young\npeople read less than they used to.\nComputing education has its own myths. Mark Guzdial's \"Top 10 Myths\nAbout Teaching Computer Science\" [3] are:\n\nThe lack of women in Computer Science is just like all the other\nSTEM fields.\n\nTo get more women in CS, we need more female CS faculty.\n\nA good CS teacher is a good lecturer.\n\nClickers and the like are an add-on for a good teacher.\n\nStudent evaluations are the best way to evaluate teaching.\n\nGood teachers personalize education for students' learning styles.\n\nHigh schools just can't teach CS well, so they shouldn't do it at all.\n\nThe real problem is to get more CS curriculum into the hands of\nteachers.\n\nAll I need to do to be a good CS teacher is model good software\ndevelopment practice, because my job is to produce excellent software\nengineers.\n\nSome people are just born to program.\n\n\nThe last of these is the most pervasive and most damaging.  As\ndiscussed in Motivation, Elizabeth Patitsas and others\nhave shown that grades in computing classes are not bimodal\n[4], i.e., there isn't one group that\ngets it and another that doesn't. Many of the participants in our\nworkshops have advanced degrees in intellectually demanding subjects,\nbut have convinced themselves that they just don't have what it takes\nto be programmers. If all we do is dispel that belief, we will have\ndone them a service.\nStarting Out\nTo begin your class, the instructors should give a brief introduction\nthat will convey their capacity to teach the material,\naccessibility and approachability, desire for student success, and\nenthusiasm. Tailor your introduction to the students' skill level so\nthat you convey competence (without seeming too advanced) and\ndemonstrate that you can relate to the students. Throughout the\nworkshop, continually demonstrate that you are interested in student\nprogress and that you are enthusiastic about the topics.\nStudents should also introduce themselves (preferably verbally). At the\nvery least, everyone should add their name to the Etherpad, but its also\ngood for everyone at a given site to know who all is in the group. Note:\nthis can be done while setting up before the start of the class.\nYou Are Not Your Learners\nPeople learn best when they care about the topic and believe they can\nmaster it. Neither fact is particularly surprising, but their\npractical implications have a lot of impact on what we teach, and the\norder in which we teach it.\nFirst, as noted in Motivation, most people don't\nactually want to program: they want to build a website or check on\nzoning regulations, and programming is just a tax they have to pay\nalong the way. They don't care how hash tables work, or even that hash\ntables exist; they just want to know how to process data faster. We\ntherefore have to make sure that everything we teach is useful right\naway, and conversely that we don't teach anything just because it's\n\"fundamental\".\nSecond, believing that something will be hard to learn is a\nself-fulfilling prophecy. This is why it's important not to say that\nsomething is easy: if someone who has been told that tries it, and it\ndoesn't work, they are more likely to become discouraged.\nIt's also why installing and configuring software is a much bigger\nproblem for us than experienced programmers like to acknowledge. It\nisn't just the time we lose at the start of boot camps as we try to\nget a Unix shell working on Windows, or set up a version control\nclient on some idiosyncratic Linux distribution.\nIt isn't even the unfairness of asking students to debug things that\ndepend on precisely the knowledge they have come to learn, but which\nthey don't yet have. The real problem is that every such failure\nreinforces the belief that computing is hard, and that they'd have a\nbetter chance of making next Thursday's deadline at work if they kept\ndoing things the way they always have. For these reasons, we have\nadopted a \"teach most immediately useful first\" approach described\nin Motivation.\nOvernight Homework\nIn a two-day class, have learners read the operations checklists as\novernight homework and do their demotivational story just before\nlunch on day 2: it means day 2 starts with their questions\n(which wakes them up), and the demotivational story is a good\nlead-in to lunchtime discussion.\nVideo Recorded Lessons\nOne of the key elements of this training course is recording trainees\nand having them, and their peers, critique those recordings. We were\nintroduced to this practice by UBC's Warren Code, and it has evolved to\nthe following:\n\nOn day 1, show trainees a short clip (3-4 minutes) of someone teaching\na lesson and have them give feedback as a group. This feedback is\norganized on two axes: positive versus negative, and content versus\npresentation. The first axis is explained as \"things to be repeated\nand emphasized\" versus \"things to be improved\", while the second is\nexplained by contrasting people who have good ideas, but can't\ncommunicate them (all content, no presentation) with people who speak\nwell, but don't actually have anything to say.\n\nTrainees are then asked to work in groups of three. Each person\nrotates through the roles of instructor, audience, and videographer.\nAs the instructor, they have two minutes to explain one key idea from\ntheir research (or other work) as if they were talking to a class of\ninterested high school students. The person pretending to be the\naudience is there to be attentive, while the videographer records the\nsession using a cellphone or similar device.\n\nAfter everyone has taught, the trio sits together and watches all\nthree videos in succession, writing out feedback on the same 2x2 grid\nintroduced above. Once all the videos have been reviewed, the group\nrejoins the class; each person puts all the feedback on themselves\ninto the shared notes.\n\n\nIn order for this exercise to work well:\n\nGroups must be physically separated to reduce audio cross-talk\nbetween their recordings. In practice, this means 2-3 groups in a\nnormal-sized classroom, with the rest using nearby breakout spaces,\ncoffee lounges, offices, or (on one occasion) a janitor's storage\ncloset.\n\nDo all three recordings before reviewing any of them, because\notherwise the person to go last is short-changed on time.\n\nPeople must give feedback on themselves, as well as giving feedback\non each other, so that they can calibrate their impressions of their\nown teaching according to the impressions of other people. (We find\nthat most people are harder on themselves than others are, and it's\nimportant for them to realize this.)\n\nAt the end of day 1, ask trainees to review the lesson episode you\nwill use for the live coding demonstration at the start of day 2.\n\nTry to make at least one mistake during the demonstration of live\ncoding so that trainees can see you talk through diagnosis and\nrecovery, and draw attention afterward to the fact that you did\nthis.\n\n\nThe announcement of this exercise is often greeted with groans and\napprehension, since few people enjoy seeing or hearing themselves.\nHowever, it is consistently rated as one of the most valuable parts of\nthe class, and also serves as an ice breaker: we want pairs of\ninstructors at actual workshops to give one another feedback, and\nthat's much easier to do once they've had some practice and have a\nrubric to follow.\nFeedback on Live Coding Demo Videos\nPart 1: How Not to Do It\n\nInstructor ignores a red sticky clearly visible on a learner's\nlaptop.\n\nInstructor is sitting, mostly looking at the laptop screen.\n\nInstructor is typing commands without saying them out loud.\n\nInstructor uses fancy shell prompt.\nFIXME: explain what this is and why it's bad.\nFIXME: put this into live coding section: \"Try to mirror the setup\nthat participants will have if they have just started with a stock\ninstallation.\"\n\nInstructor uses small font in not full-screen terminal window with\nblack background.\n\nThe terminal window bottom is partially blocked by the learner's\nheads for those sitting in the back.\n\nInstructor receives a a pop-up notification in the middle of the\nsession.\n\nInstructor makes a mistake (a typo) but simply fixes it without\npointing it out, and redoes the command.\n\n\nPart 2: How to Do It Right\n\nInstructor checks if the learner with the red sticky on her laptop\nstill needs attention.\n\nInstructor is standing while instructing, making eye-contact with\nparticipants.\n\nInstructor is saying the commands out loud while typing them.\n\nInstructor moves to the screen to point out details of commands or\nresults.\n\nInstructor simply uses $ as shell prompt.\n\nInstructor uses big font in wide-screen terminal window with white\nbackground.\n\nThe terminal window bottom is above the learner's heads for those\nsitting in the back.\n\nInstructor makes mistake (a typo) and uses the occasion to\nillustrate how to interpret error-messages.\n\n\nMotivation and Demotivation\nIn the exercise on brainstorming demotivational experiences, review\nthe comments in the shared notes. Rather than read all out loud,\nhighlight a few of the things that could have been done\ndifferently. This will give everyone some confidence in how to handle\nthese situations in the future.\nLogistics\nThis course has been taught as a multi-week online class, as a two-day\nin-person class, and as a two-day class in which the learners are in\nco-located groups and the instructor participates remotely.\nMulti-Week Online\nThis was the first format we used, and we no longer recommend it.\n\nWe met every week or every second week for an hour using Google\nHangout or BlueJeans. Each meeting is held twice (or even three\ntimes) to accommodate learners' time zones and because video\nconferencing systems can't handle 60+ people at once.\n\nEach meeting also uses an Etherpad or Google Doc for shared\nnote-taking, and more importantly for asking and answering\nquestions: having several dozen people try to talk on a call hasn't\nworked, so in most sessions, the instructor does the talking and\nlearners respond through the Etherpad chat.\n\nLearners post homework online between classes, and comment on each\nother's work.  In practice, it turned out to be hard to get people\nto comment in detail (or at all).\n\nWe used a WordPress blog for the first ten rounds of training.\nPeople found writing and commenting on posts straightforward, but\nsetting up dozens of logins was tedious.\n\nWe tried a GitHub-backed blog in the Winter 2015 class. It didn't\nwork nearly as well: a third of the participants found it extremely\nfrustrating, and post-publication commentary was awkward.\n\nWe tried Piazza in the Fall 2015 class. It was better than GitHub,\nbut still not as good as a simple WordPress blog. In particular, it\nwas hard to find things once there were more than a dozen homework\ncategories.\n\n\nTwo-Day In-Person\nThis was the second method we tried. The biggest change was the\nintroduction of recorded teaching exercises.\n\nSeveral times during the training, participants are divided into\ngroups of three and asked to teach a short lesson (typically 2-3\nminutes long). In turn, one person is the teacher, one the audience,\nand one the videographer, who records the teacher using a handheld\ndevice such as a phone. Group members then rotate roles: the teacher\nbecomes the listener, the listener records, and the videographer\nteaches. Once all three have finished teaching, the group reviews\nall three videos, and everyone gives feedback on everyone (including\nthemselves). This feedback then goes into the Etherpad for\ndiscussion.\n\nIt's important to record all three videos and then watch all three:\nif the cycle is teach-review-teach-review, the last person to teach\nruns out of time. Doing all the reviewing after all the teaching\nalso helps put a bit of distance between the teaching and the\nreviewing, which makes the exercise slightly less excruciating.\n\nWe use Etherpad or Google Doc for in-person training, both for\nnote-taking and for posting exercise solutions and feedback on\nrecorded lessons.  Questions and discussion are done aloud.\n\n\nTwo-Day Online With Groups\nIn this format, learners are in groups of 4-12, but those groups are\ngeographically distributed.\n\nWe use Google Hangouts and either Etherpad or Google Docs as in the\nmulti-week version. Each group of learners is together in a room\nusing one camera and microphone, rather than each being on the call\nseparately. We have found that having good audio matters more than\nhaving good video, and that the better the audio, the more learners\ncan communicate with the instructor and other rooms by voice rather\nthan by using the Etherpad chat.\n\nWe do the video lecture exercise as in the two-day in-person training.\n\n\nEffecting Change\nThis guide is aimed primarily at people working outside mainstream\neducational institutions, but in order for us to reach and help as\nmany people as possible, we must eventually find ways to work with\nschools as they are.  Henderson et al's \"Facilitating Change in\nUndergraduate STEM Instructional Practices\"\n[5] discusses ways to get educational\ninstitutions to actually change what they teach.  The approaches\nthey identify include:\n\nDiffusion: STEM undergraduate instruction will be changed by\naltering the behavior of a large number of individual\ninstructors. The greatest influences for changing instructor\nbehavior lie in optimizing characteristics of the innovation and\nexploiting the characteristics of individuals and their networks.\n\nImplementation: STEM undergraduate instruction will be\nchanged by developing research-based instructional \"best\npractices\" and training instructors to use them. Instructors must\nuse these practices with fidelity to the established standard.\n\nScholarly Teaching: STEM undergraduate instruction will be\nchanged when more individual faculty members treat their teaching as\na scholarly activity.\n\nFaculty Learning Communities: STEM undergraduate instruction\nwill be changed by groups of instructors who support and sustain\neach other's interest, learning, and reflection on their teaching.\n\nQuality Assurance: STEM undergraduate instruction will be\nchanged by requiring institutions (colleges, schools, departments,\nand degree programs) to collect evidence demonstrating their success\nin undergraduate instruction. What gets measured is what gets\nimproved.\n\nOrganizational Development: STEM undergraduate instruction\nwill be changed by administrators with strong vision who can develop\nstructures and motivate faculty to adopt improved instructional\npractices.\n\nLearning Organizations: Innovation in higher education STEM\ninstruction will occur through informal communities of practice\nwithin formal organizations in which individuals develop new\norganizational knowledge through sharing implicit knowledge about\ntheir teaching.  Leaders cultivate conditions for both formal and\ninformal communities to form and thrive.\n\nComplexity Leadership: STEM undergraduate instruction is\ngoverned by a complex system. Innovation will occur through the\ncollective action of self-organizing groups within the system. This\ncollective action can be stimulated, but not controlled.\n\n\nWhy We Are Not a MOOC\n\nIf you use robots to teach, you teach people to be robots.– variously attributed\n\nMassive open online courses (MOOCs) in which students watch videos\ninstead of attending lectures, and then do assignments that are\n(usually) robo-graded, were a hot topic a few years ago.  Now that the\nhype has worn off, though, it's clear that they aren't as effective as\ntheir more enthusiastic proponents claimed they would\nbe [6].\nRecorded content is ineffective for most novices learners because it\ncannot intervene to clear up specific learners' misconceptions. Some\npeople happen to already have the right conceptual categories for a\nsubject, or happen to form them correctly early on; these are the ones\nwho stick with most massive online courses, but many discussions of\nthe effectiveness of such courses ignore this survivor bias.\n\n1Andrew Gelman and Deborah Nolan, Teaching Statistics: A Bag of Tricks, Oxford University Press, 2002.2Pedro De Bruyckere and Paul A.
